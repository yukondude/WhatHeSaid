With a new population of 40K, according to the cube root rule ([nyti.ms/2Dh1ukX?smid=nâ€¦](https://nyti.ms/2Dh1ukX?smid=nytcore-ios-share)), [#Yukon](https://twitter.com/hashtag/yukon) should have a whopping 34 MLAs in its legislature. Probably best to approximate a tesseract root rule in the North. [#mathisfun](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mathisfun)
