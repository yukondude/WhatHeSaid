<p>...remarked <a href="http://www.artincanada.com/jimrobb/index.html">Jim Robb</a> upon hearing that I had just passed the ten year mark in our cozy out-of-the-way territory. Strange, I had thought that only a single solid winter earned one the Sourdough rank -- and I can remember a couple of doozies over the past decade; especially that two weeks of minus forty about five years ago that, if nothing else, helped to educate the Alaskans about degrees centigrade.</p>
<p>No time to reminisce though. I'm far too eager to see what the next ten will bring.</p>
