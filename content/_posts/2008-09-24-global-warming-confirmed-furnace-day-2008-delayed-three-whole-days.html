  content: I often saw my breath in my Carcross cabin, but decided that the city house
    will stay warm. I was firing the wood furnace occasionally throughout this whole
    nasty summer. Global Warming - humbug! "Climate change" I'll buy though - it's
    a whole new world in the Yukon for sure, and most other places by the looks of
    the news.

  content: How I've longed for a wood stove to take the edge off those chilly days.
    Unfortunately, my insurance agent also longs for the extra premiums that would
    involve, and so both of our wishes must go unfulfilled.

<p>No statistician worth her σ<sup>2</sup> would call that a confirmation. Nonetheless, the summer that many considered the most cold, damp, and dreary in recent memory held off Furnace Day for 72 hours.</p>
<p>As none but the eidetic will recall, <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/09/19/september-19-2007-furnace-day/">last year's Furnace Day fell on September 19th</a>. As always, I waited the arrival of visible breath in the living room before lighting the whistling propane on the evening of September 22nd.</p>
<p>Assuming the current trend is linear, the next Furnace Day will be celebrated on September 25th, 2009. Mark your calendars.</p>
