<p>...but I'm not, and unfortunately, "Occidental-oriented" is an ornamented accident.</p>
<p>Put much more simply, Carole and I took the <a href="http://www.yukonorienteering.ca/">Yukon Orienteering Association</a>'s "Learn to 'O' Clinic" yesterday, ostensibly so that we could devote even more of our time to being lost in the woods.</p>
<p>The day was spent learning to read the highly-detailed orienteering topographical maps, and then scrambling about <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Yukon+College+Ayamdigut+Campus,+Whitehorse,+Yukon+Territory,+Canada&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=46.14027,93.076172&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Yukon+College+Ayamdigut+Campus,&amp;hnear=Whitehorse,+YT,+Canada&amp;ll=60.749473,-135.1051&amp;spn=0.006773,0.022724&amp;t=h&amp;z=16">out back of the College</a> with said maps. Learning to find bearings with the compass was also helpful, but at our level the maps are far more useful.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.yukonorienteering.ca/calendarofevents.html">YOA holds meets every second Wednesday</a>, and we're planning to attempt the more casual routes: the ones with fewer crossed contour lines, and with controls (checkpoints) conveniently located near trails.</p>
