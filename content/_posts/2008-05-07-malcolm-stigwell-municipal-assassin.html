  content: Hahaha!  I'm not sure whether I love or hate that I have to read it twice
    to really get it, but it sure tickled my funny-bone.

<p>The little bit of non-technical writing that I do tends to be inspired by random odd phrases that strike me as amusing. "Municipal assassin" is one such phrase that still tickles.</p>
<p>I fleshed it out into a very short, non-traditional, "postcard" story for a creative writing course I took last year.</p>
<p>And with that, I present: <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/what-he-wrote/malcolm-stigwell-municipal-assassin/">Malcolm Stigwell, Municipal Assassin</a>.</p>
