<p>Continuing from my <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/06/15/there-can-be-only-none-kurgan-vcr-beheads-my-copy-of-highlander-will-c-61-let-me-copy-what-remains/">previous </a><span class="secondary-bf"><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/06/15/there-can-be-only-none-kurgan-vcr-beheads-my-copy-of-highlander-will-c-61-let-me-copy-what-remains/">circumlocutory post</a>, here is a simple list of the things that will be denied us by Bill C-61 should it gain Royal Assent:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>make backups of our DVDs,</li>
<li>move our media to other devices,</li>
<li>use our media in perpetuity,</li>
<li>exercise our rights to fair dealing,</li>
<li>re-mix DRM-ed public domain material,</li>
<li>unlock our phones,</li>
<li>use all of our phones' features, and</li>
<li>remove DRM software.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is taken -- dare I say, <em>copied</em> -- from <a href="http://www.brendonwilson.com/blog/2008/06/16/talking-points-to-defeat-bill-c-61/">a very readable and concise series of talking points to defeat Bill C-61 by Brendon Wilson</a>.</p>
<p><a class="def" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Geist">Michael Geist</a> is also <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/blogsection/0/125/">writing about common family activities that will become illegal under Bill C-61 in a week-long series</a>.</p>
<p>The Globe also featured <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080613.wgtcopyrightchat0613/BNPrint/Technology/home">an interview about the bill with University of Ottawa professor, Jeremy deBeer</a>, which illustrates just how few copyright-related activities that Canadians take for granted will still be allowed should the bill pass.</p>
<p>Here are just <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/3031/125/">three things we all can do to protest Bill C-61</a>. I worry that 30 minutes with <a href="http://webinfo.parl.gc.ca/membersofparliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=78942&amp;Language=E">Larry</a> might render me unconcious, but Meat Loaf told me -- in person (Kingston, 1987) -- that two out of three ain't bad.</p>
