<p>Under the couch in a far corner of a small university pub, four 20-something fellows find an unlocked briefcase containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>one paperback thriller novel,</li>
<li>one crossword puzzle printed on a sheet of 8-1/2 by 11 paper, and</li>
<li>one 1/2-pound solid milk chocolate Easter rabbit, intact.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-860" title="The Easter Briefcase" src="/heap/easter-briefcase.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="266" />The lads think themselves honest, so close the lid and tuck the briefcase back under the couch to wait for its owner's return.</p>
<p>"Let's have another look at that puzzle."</p>
<p>The clues seem unusually difficult, and so back goes the briefcase. Somehow the ears of the bunny fall off along the way.</p>
<p>"Let's see if the novel's any good."</p>
<p>Critiques are offered, and the briefcase returns again, the rabbit slightly decapitated.</p>
<p>"Let's just eat the damned bunny already."</p>
<p>At the end of the evening, the briefcase is handed in trust to the barkeep containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>one paperback thriller novel, and</li>
<li>one crossword puzzle printed on a sheet of 8-1/2 by 11 paper.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The events as I have described them occurred some twenty-three years ago this week. The mystery of the briefcase's contents and owner remains unsolved.</em></p>
