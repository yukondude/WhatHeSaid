  content: As part of the housekeeping, I upgraded WordPress and enabled comments
    while I was at it. I wonder if any of it will work?

<p>Yesterday was Database Upgrade Day -- from MySQL 4.x to 5.0 -- which is why, had you visited, you would've noticed a big fat WordPress error message rather than all these little purty words.</p>
<p>I had put off upgrading the DB for some time. MySQL 5.0 ships with extra monkey wrenches baked in to the core database, and upgrading-in-place was tougher than I had hoped.</p>
<p>This being a <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> server, upgrading also meant recompiling everything from scratch: a 2-hour <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_%28computer_science%29" class="def">thrashmaganza</a> on this old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeron" class="def">Celeron</a> bucket. Then PHP had to be re-compiled in order to talk to this latest MySQL interface. I wasn't about to wait up for that to finish.</p>
<p>Just the price one pays for the mock-prestige of running one's own server.</p>
