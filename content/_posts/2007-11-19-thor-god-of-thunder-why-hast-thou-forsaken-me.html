Subject: Goddamn blackouts</p>
<p>Yet another of our <a href="http://www.yukonenergy.ca/">multiple power outages</a> today, right in the middle of burning a backup DVD on one computer, and upgrading the operating system on another. Also waiting for an important e-mail message that hopefully wasn't bounced back to the sender in such a way as to suggest that I'm incapable of competently managing an e-mail server. All told, I lost 2.5 hours of semi-productivity, which converts to...including GST...at least seven beans and a plastic whistle.</p>
<p>Perhaps my blog entries of late have offended the patron gods of Yukon Energy/Electrical.</p>
<p>Silver Lining: due to much recent practice, I can now reset all of the house's clocks and timers in under fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>I see <a href="http://subvert.ca/blog/archive/survive-blackout/">Geoff was also caught in the dark</a>.</p>
