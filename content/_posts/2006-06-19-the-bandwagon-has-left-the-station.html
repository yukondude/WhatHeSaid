<p>Depending upon your count, this blog has launched 10 or 12 years after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weblog" target="_blank">first blog post</a>. Given my innate sense for such things, blogs will likely be declared pass√© tomorrow. Be that as it may; I'm writing for myself.</p>
<p>So how did you get here anyway?</p>
