<p>Ignoring my <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/09/20/the-mac-came-back/">pledge to buy an Apple Macintosh</a>, I yellow-bellied my way to the <a href="http://www.dell.ca/">Dell site</a> last April and bought one of their <a href="http://www1.ca.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop_studio_17?c=ca&amp;cs=cadhs1&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs">unstylish yet bell-and-whistlesome models</a>. Yes, I am weak. But at half the price of the comparable Mac, I saved enough for that spine and guts transplant I'd always wanted.</p>
<p>For three months, all was peaches and edible oil based dessert topping. Not two weeks before I was scheduled to <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2009/08/27/so-youre-going-to-drive-to-the-yukon/">leave the territory for the entire summer</a>, the screen goes black. The kind of hazy green-tinged black that suggests nothing but frustration and expense.</p>
<p>The diagnosis, from my <a href="http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/">College</a> colleagues who have fixed a broken computer or two, was that the screen backlight had blown. Prognosis: I would be sending it back to Dell.</p>
<p>Yet with days to go before my trip, I figured it best to lug it with me and deal with Customer Support once I arrived in one of the big cities on the itinerary. Decades of computing experience has led me to despise customer "support," so postponing that hassle was okay-fine by me.</p>
<p>Following several further postponements, I sat down with my computer, the telephone, a pen, my purchase invoice and warranty documents, and steeled myself for a couple of hours of intense "support."</p>
<p>After a few introductory explanations and the reading of many multi-digit numbers across the line, Sunjit, my support technician, said "Sounds like the backlight. We'll ship a box for you to return it in this afternoon."</p>
<p>Really? They do that? I had assumed that I'd be responsible for "all packaging, shipping, and unexplained ancillary costs." I was also flabbergasted to find that my warranty was for a full year, rather than the typical ninety days.</p>
<p>I thanked Sunjit profusely, and, later that afternoon, packed up my laptop in the box that arrived just as promised. It was shipped back less than a week later, with a fully restored screen and everything else just as I had left it (including my non-supported Linux dual-boot setup).</p>
<p>I have recommended Dell to others for years, and will continue to do so after this episode. I have heard horror stories of Dell support and product quality, but only anecdotally or on the web -- <em>if it's spellchecked, it must be true</em>. My experience continues to be positive. Good on ya, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dell">Mike</a>.</p>
