<p>I've just now realized that I've been blogging for <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2006/06/19/the-bandwagon-has-left-the-station/">five years plus a smidge</a>. So, this seems like an opportune time to look back over the two-hundred-and-then-some posts and update any stale announcements and also see whether any of my predictions have come to pass.</p>
<p><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2006/07/07/apache-and-the-case-of-the-spurious-permission-snafu/">Apache and the case of the spurious permission snafu</a> was hands-down the least interesting thing I've ever written on-line, and yet the problem it discusses keeps cropping up: as recently as a month ago on my new Mac desktop when I set up a local webserver.</p>
<p>Only slightly more interesting, but responsible for an astounding percentage of traffic to my blog, were these unnotable entries: <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2006/07/21/the-letter-l-how-do-you-spell-that/">The letter L. How do you spell that?</a>, <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2006/07/30/how-do-you-spell-queue/">How do you spell Queue?</a>, <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/11/14/heres-your-damned-yukon-blackout-map-mashup/">Here’s your damned Yukon Blackout Map Mashup.</a>, <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/02/11/how-to-convert-a-websites-content-into-simple-text-files/">How to convert a website’s content into simple text files.</a> (by far the biggest hit), <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/07/18/the-making-of-a-simile/">The Making of a Simile.</a>, and <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2010/10/30/i-must-confess-that-i-can-only-follow-the-diagrammed-steps-to-the-time-warp/">I must confess that I can only follow the diagrammed steps to the Time Warp…</a> (mainly from folks searching for Riff Raff).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cheechakos.com/">Cheechako's</a> is still <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2006/08/02/the-most-wonderful-yukon-web-page-evar/">The. Most. Wonderful. Yukon. Web. Page. Evar.</a> Just click and watch the awesomeness.</p>
<p><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2006/12/08/what-he-said-readership-surges-400-after-joining-urban-yukon/">I still get most of my readers from Urban Yukon</a>. The automatic link from Facebook or occasional <a href="http://twitter.com/yukondude">tweet</a> also seems to help.</p>
<p>My hot-and-cold relationship with Yukon College is cold at the moment, but scheduled to re-heat come September. I think it's safe to say that the College will never, ever attempt to hire me again for a full-time or permanent position, and that's okay by me: <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/01/27/back-to-work-at-school-breaking-a-half-of-two-rules/">Back to work at school. Breaking a half of two rules.</a>, <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/09/04/for-the-first-time-in-many-a-year-tomorrow-is-not-a-school-day/">For the first time in many a year, tomorrow is not a school day.</a>, <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/12/18/no-seriously-big-time-it-contracting-opportunities-at-the-college/">No, seriously. BIG-TIME IT contracting opportunities at the College.</a>, <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/10/25/perspective-shift/">Perspective Shift</a>, and <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2009/07/02/manager-no-more/">Manager no more.</a></p>
<p>In the Burying The Lede category, I <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/07/11/here-be-the-news/">announced my marriage</a> ninth on the list after eggrolls and meatballs.</p>
<p>Aside from the weather, I'm freakishly obsessed with my furnace: <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/09/19/september-19-2007-furnace-day/">on</a>, <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/05/23/may-23-2008-no-furnace-day/">off</a>, <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/09/24/global-warming-confirmed-furnace-day-2008-delayed-three-whole-days/">on</a>, <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2009/05/18/may-17-2009-no-furnace-day/">off</a>, and <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2009/09/28/the-short-est-day/">on</a> (with sparks).</p>
<p>Still waiting for the States to completely <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/11/07/has-america-jumped-the-shark/">Jump the Shark</a>. <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2010/10/15/mortgage-meltdown-foreclosure-fiasco-either-way-im-hooked/">Mortgages haven't completely melted down</a> either.</p>
<p>I am still <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2010/04/01/and-then-he-turned-to-me-and-whispered-dave-ive-stopped-using-soap/">soapless</a> after a year and a half with no apparent harm to anyone but Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>
<p><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2010/05/19/i-have-predicted-the-future-of-social-networking/">I have predicted the future of Social Networking.</a> Unless <a href="http://plus.google.com/">Google+</a> catches on. But what are the odds?</p>
<p><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2010/07/06/back-to-my-shaving-future/">Ye olde safety razor</a> is a pleasure to use and I spend maybe a quarter of what I used to on blades.</p>
<p><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2010/11/20/insert-joke-about-a-vacuum-cleaner-that-really-sucks-here/">The Dyson vacuum is really amazing</a>. It picks up everything and only needs a filter wash every few months. It's too big to roll under most furniture, and the attachment hose is downright cranky, but otherwise it's a shinbone happystance glazierino, pappy. (I'm fresh out of superlatives.)</p>
<p>See you in five years, ere the Eon of Robotic Hegemony and the 3.1th Coming of the CyberChrist.</p>
