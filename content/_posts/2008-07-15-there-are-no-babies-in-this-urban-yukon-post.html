  content: You know what you need to do, Dave. A candlelight dinner, nice bottle of
    wine, rose petals sprinkled around the house...and then a year later you can fit
    right into the baby crowd. ~wink.

  content: I read once, and completely agree, that becoming a parent is akin to turning
    into a vampire. Your old self dies a sad, painful death but you re-emerge as a
    zombie-like immortal with superpower strength. Maybe even a cape. The latter attribute
    alone makes it worth a shot.

    Dogs are just peoples furry babies.

    Geof, I like the cape thing.  Should we be wearing our underwear on the outside of our pants as well?

    Great idea kara!  I can just picture all the Urban Yukon bloggers now... ew. Kind of a scary thought actually. :)

    And we should maybe dress our dogs up like babies. Would make scooping poop that much easier!!

    The story thus far: baby blogs come from super-powered underwear zombies. These zombies then go on to infect other blogs, creating mutant dog-baby hybrids.

    There is no cure.

<p>If you're a daily reader of the posts on <a href="http://www.urbanyukon.com/">Urban Yukon</a>, you may have noticed a trend of late: babies. And not just one, mind, but scores of the little buggers, popping out of our territory's bloggers like tarts from a toaster.</p>
<p>In truth, I like the wee googagglers. They smell nice (mostly). Look cute (mostly). And, try as I might, cannot be legitimately blamed for any of the various ills that afflict me.</p>
<p>But in aggregate, the topic of babies occupies my mind maybe one twelfth of one percent on a daily basis, so the proportion of papoose-pertinent postings appearing on UY lately is... like... totally whack.</p>
<p>I guess the only solution is to press for many more engaging articles on blackout mashups, relational databases, and the presently-dormant Bill C-61. Now <em>that's</em> what attracts droves of RSS subscribers.</p>
