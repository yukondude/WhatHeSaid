<p>As we wait for NorthwesTel's (edit: actually, Bell Canada's) weary and underappreciated fibre-optic cable repair team to splice together the line <a href="http://whitehorsestar.com/archive/story/dawson-creek-contractor-created-latest-service-woes/">cut near Dawson Creek yesterday</a>, following the<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/north/story/2009/06/15/whse-fibre-optic.html"> cut at Smith River Monday</a>, and the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/north/story/2009/06/10/northwestel-cable-cut.html">cut at Marsh Lake last Wednesday</a>, it's natural to wonder why these buried lines are so irresistible to backhoe operators.</p>
<p>I think we can trace the problem to the following three poorly-conceived NorthwesTel plans:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sheathing the lines in a camouflage-pattern covering to hide them from the post-9/11 terrorists that jihad all up and down the Alaska Highway.</li>
<li>Magnetizing the fibres to better contain the awesome power of the electromagnetic forces coursing through the glass strands at light speed, rendering the cable highly attractive to steel-toothed buckets.</li>
<li>Carefully denoting the buried cable at strategic spots with large X marks and guarding each with a flapping skull and crossbones pennant, alerting everyone in the area to the precious communications treasure that lies beneath.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, what else could explain it?</p>
