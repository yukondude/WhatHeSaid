  content: I think the same day I wrote that, Merriam-Webster announced that <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/07words.htm"

<p><em>This is a notable addition to the never-ending Yukon Blackout Mashup &amp; Feed Saga.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=w00t" class="def">W00t</a>! You may now subscribe to <a href="http://www.yukonenergy.ca/news/outages/">planned power outage bulletins</a> from <a href="http://www.yukonenergy.ca/">Yukon Energy</a>'s site via <a href="http://www.yukonenergy.ca/info/rss/">RSS</a>. (What? No <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29" class="def">Atom</a> feed? &lt;wink&gt;)</p>
<p>Thanks are due mostly to Janet Patterson who made all this happen after stumbling upon my <a href="/2007/10/29/i-also-want-a-yukon-energy-blackout-rss-feed/">self-interested griping</a>.</p>
<p>I now resolve to pursue <a href="http://www.yukonelectrical.com/">Yukon Electrical</a> with renewed vigour to realize my ultimate goal of a <a href="/2007/11/14/heres-your-damned-yukon-blackout-map-mashup/">Yukon blackout map mashup</a>.</p>
