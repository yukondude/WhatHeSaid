<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-488" style="margin-left:10px" title="Ain't he cute?" src="/heap/casebase-logo.gif" alt="" width="64" height="66" />For my first programming contract as as a private businessman, I was paid with a moose dinner and a hand-knit Icelandic sweater. I had written a small desktop database program to permit the quick 'n easy entry of Yukon civil and criminal court case decisions. It would then spit out these decisions in many eye-pleasing formats that would then be bound into thick legal volumes, of the sort most commonly seen lining the studies of late-night TV lawyer commercials.</p>
<p>"Software never rusts" is a saying in my profession, and this program -- called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/casebase/">caseBase</a> and featuring my <a href="http://yukondude.com/">little dude</a> in a barrister's wig and robe as its icon -- bears out the saying, generating law library lining to this day.</p>
<p>Since it's still running, I still support it, but the payment currency has changed somewhat, and for the better:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/heap/fancy-beer.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-499" title="Six exotic friends in a row." src="/heap/fancy-beer.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="358" /></a><p>Six exotic friends in a row.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center">
<p>Now, twelve or twenty-four bottles to a box is a fine thing, but a single bottle in its own box is something rare indeed.</p>
<p>Thanks, Margaret!</p>
