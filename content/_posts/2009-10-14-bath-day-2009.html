  content: It's actually more tan/brown, what with the one wall made of cedar, and
    about five other types of wood in there. For some reason, it comes out pinkish
    whenever photographed. I suspect the camera and/or the special "daylight" vanity
    lightbulbs.

<p>Few thrills surpass the washing of an 85-pound dog. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10684779@N03/1305667647/in/set-72157601821696750/">Smidgen</a> was unusually cooperative this past Saturday, leaving our tub area reasonably unscathed:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/heap/after-bath.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-573" title="Post traumatic bath debris" src="/heap/after-bath.jpg" alt="Post traumatic bath debris" width="490" height="368" /></a><p>Post traumatic bath debris</p></div>
<p>It took us just as long to clean up afterwards as all the brushing, combing, lathering, rinsing, toweling, conditioning, combing, blow-drying, and combing yet again, put together.</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/heap/after-after-bath.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-574" title="Evidence of prior bath trauma, now skillfully concealed." src="/heap/after-after-bath.jpg" alt="Evidence of prior bath trauma, now skillfully concealed." width="490" height="368" /></a><p>Evidence of prior bath trauma, now skillfully concealed.</p></div>
<p>And now she should be good until next spring's melt.</p>
