<p>I've spent the past hour virtually touring Prague. Much more interesting and seamless than Google Street View: <a href="http://www.360cities.net/prague-18-gigapixels">www.360cities.net/prague-18-gigapixels</a></p>
<p>See if you can spot:</p>
<ul>
<li>smoking dude with lemon drink and little white dog (hint: circle to the east),</li>
<li>smiling boy hanging from bars surrounding the ball court (due west),</li>
<li>garden oasis above the abandoned and graffiti-splattered tour operator (just past the hanging boy), or</li>
<li>sweethearts gamboling through the park (forested park to the north).</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry, no prizes for finding any of that, but there is some sort of <a href="http://blog.360cities.net/gigapixel-treasure-hunt-win-1000/">treasure hunt</a> going on within the photograph.</p>
<p>I love the central courtyard design of housing blocks in Old Europe. Must be noisy though. I wonder if they outlaw elevators to limit the building heights. Shame about the satellite dishes everywhere.</p>
