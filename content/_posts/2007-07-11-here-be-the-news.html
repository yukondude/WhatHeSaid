  content: Well, it's a good thing you posted this. I was under the impression that
    you had a full-time teaching gig at Yukon College. Lucky that's cleared up now.

  content: Actually, the job I turned down both times was that of a DBA/programmer.
    I usually taught only one or two courses each term. They've advertised the DBA
    position (http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/human_resources/job_postings/HR0751.php)
    should anyone be interested.

<p>I've given up telling other people -- including family -- what it is that I've been up to of late. Talking to other people, well, that's just not the sort of thing I <em>do</em>.</p>
<p>Instead, I'll just post stuff here. No one reads this -- including family -- and so the net information dispersal effect is the same.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, if any of this gets out by other means, I can joyfully claim: "How can you not know that? I posted it on my blog months ago."</p>
<p>So here goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>I ate too many egg rolls for dinner last night.</li>
<li>I rolled my truck off the highway in 2004.</li>
<li>I moved to the Yukon in 1999.</li>
<li>I ate too many egg rolls for lunch three days ago.</li>
<li>I turned down a permanent job offer at Yukon College in 2005.</li>
<li>As of last summer, I am five years cancer-free.</li>
<li>I ate too much spaghetti and meatballs two nights in a row over the weekend.</li>
<li>I turned down the same permanent job offer at Yukon College two weeks ago.</li>
<li>I married Carole June 21st.</li>
<li>I ate too much fondue at the reception.</li>
</ul>
