  content: That's actually the target date. Although if he comes a day early, that
    will give him time to get down to the hardware shop and pick up something for
    dear old dad.

<p>Fellow <a href="http://urbanyukon.com/">Urban Yukon</a>-er <a href="http://writeramandamcdonald.blogspot.ca/">Amanda McDonald</a> has encouraged us erstwhile bloggers to get off our duffs and blog for a month. I was in need of a good duff lift, since I haven't managed to post much beyond an echoed Twitter feed in some time.</p>
<p>So, in the spirit of the <a href="http://writeramandamcdonald.blogspot.ca/p/yukon-blog-carnival.html">carnival</a>, I will attempt the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post at least twice a week, not including Twitter nonsense, and</li>
<li>Occasionally address this year's carnival theme: Blogging in 2012.</li>
</ul>
<p>In theory, this particular month should provide much blog fodder as we're expecting a baby any day now, with maximum ejection probability around mid-month.</p>
<p>Here we go...</p>
