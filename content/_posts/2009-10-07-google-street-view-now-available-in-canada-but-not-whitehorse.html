<p>I've been "driving" around Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver today on <a href="http://maps.google.ca/help/maps/streetview/">Google's Street View</a>. Just visit an address in a city down south in <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> and then drag the little orange man icon over to the street of your choice.</p>
<p>Apparently <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/google-gives-canada-a-street-view/article1315242/">Street View in Canada just went live earlier today</a>. I had heard that the <a href="http://explorenorth.com/wordpress/?p=274">Street View car had toured Whitehorse</a> back in <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the spring</span> <span style="color: #800000">July</span>, but it doesn't seem to work up here yet, dagnabbit.</p>
<p>My high school <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=glebe+collegiate+institute,+ottawa,+ontario&amp;sll=49.26528,-123.134443&amp;sspn=0.131734,0.363579&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=glebe+collegiate+institute,&amp;hnear=Ottawa,+ON,+Canada&amp;ll=45.401704,-75.695715&amp;spn=0,359.909105&amp;t=h&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=45.401629,-75.695875&amp;panoid=4TRmdHjONmucyMF1_CQfvQ&amp;cbp=12,310.29,,0,5">looks pretty much the same</a> as it did in the early 80s, and the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=bay+and+king,+toronto,+ontario&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=40.817312,93.076172&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=King+St+W+&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=43.648641,-79.380268&amp;panoid=gjjkOz20EhgoTA03wHC_aw&amp;cbp=12,333.38,,0,5">financial heart of our country</a> seems calm (they must've taken the picture before the start of the Great Recession).</p>
