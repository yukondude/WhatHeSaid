    If you want to thicken the sauce, do the garlic butter &amp; cream first, boil it down until it reaches the consistency you want), then add the salmon &amp; other stuff.

    The only thing I would add is try to make your own egg pasta (two eggs per cup of flour--nothing else, mix, knead, roll out &amp; cut your tagliatelle).

     (only whipping cream will work, the other stuff will curdle, I'm talking about a heavy rolling boil).

    and it not "experimenting coronary suffering", but should be "soffrano di malattie coronarie". :-)

    Thanks for the tip, Luigi, and also for the grammar correction. Google Translate won't put any real translators out of business for a while.

    My dad and I made our own noodles once. Given the time and effort required, I'll be settling with the packaged variety for most occasions.

  content: What does that have to do with salmon fettuccini?

<p>While my cooking style tends toward the <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2009/09/17/blustery-day-comfort-food-recipes-from-my-bachelor-youth/">lowest end of the cuisine spectrum</a>, I recently pulled off quite a dish in an effort to use up all of the fresh smoked salmon that we had in the freezer (Carole knows a guy). Of course, it's hard to go wrong when cooking with salmon, butter, and whipping cream.</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/heap/heart-smart.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-703 " title="A-ha-ha-ha-ha!" src="/heap/heart-smart.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="60" /></a><p>A-ha-ha-ha-ha!</p></div>
<p>Start water boiling and add:</p>
<ul>
<li>One pack fettuccini or linguini, or whatever noodles you like</li>
</ul>
<p>Sauté, in a largish pan:</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 of one of those large garlic thingies, minced</li>
<li>1/4 cup butter</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the garlic starts to go translucent, add:</p>
<ul>
<li>2-3 cups of shredded and deboned fresh smoked salmon</li>
</ul>
<p>Reduce to medium heat, and cook for another two minutes, stirring frequently, then slowly add:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups of whipping cream</li>
<li>1/4 cup grated parmesan or, better yet, asiago</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep stirring for another five minutes or so. The sauce won't thicken appreciably. Once the noodles are done, mix in all of the sauce. Serve in big bowls and top each with:</p>
<ul>
<li>dash of fresh parsley</li>
<li>warm diced tomato</li>
<li>freshly cracked pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Buon appetito! Non è raccomandato per coloro che sono intolleranti al lattosio, sperimentando la sofferenza coronarica, o con i cibi kosher.</em></p>
