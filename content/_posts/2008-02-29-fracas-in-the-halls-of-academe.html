    At least they don't arrive with huge MS Word attachments anymore.

<p>What really puts a bee in the bonnet of the elbow patch and pipe set atop the hill at <a href="http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/">Yukon College</a>?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Suspicious selection of the president?</li>
<li>Assault in the residence?</li>
<li>Bears in the garbage bin?</li>
<li>Turnover in the computer support department?</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer: None of the above. No, only one topic could launch an all-out week-long e-mail melee, dragging in everyone from the union president to the registrar to the facilities supervisor:</p>
<p>Sandwiches.</p>
<p>And not just sandwiches, but the precise location where said sandwiches -- charitable sandwiches! -- might be assembled.</p>
<p>There's really no point in continuing to describe this ridiculous episode, other than to repeat, one last time, "sandwiches."</p>
