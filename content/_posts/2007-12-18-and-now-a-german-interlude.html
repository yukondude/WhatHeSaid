<p>Interesting news with respect to the <a href="/2007/12/12/it-contracting-opportunities-at-the-college/">IT situation at the College</a> should be appearing here soon, perhaps this evening. Meanwhile...</p>
<p>Speaking of the College, I enrolled in the introductory German class this past term. It's a surprisingly fun language: dead simple to pronounce once you grasp the cat-hiss "ch" sound, a real boost to your English grammar proficiency as you learn to identify and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declension">decline</a> Nouns, and chock full of phrases that lend real authenticity to your daily <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0459252/">Colonel Klink</a> shtick.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the class was over all too soon, limiting me to ordering <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A4tzle" class="def">Spätzle</a></em> in a train station while telling the time. The longest sentence I've yet mastered is one I taught myself years ago in case of emergency: <em>Mein Auto ist gefüllt mit Rasierschaum</em>.</p>
<p>Translation: my car is filled with shaving cream. I think we can all agree, that is the very definition of an emergency.</p>
<p>In closing, I offer a little ode to the Germans that I penned many years ago, sung to the tune of the theme song from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Robin_Hood" class="def">Rocket Robin Hood</a>:</p>
<p>We are German.<br />
We speak German.<br />
We've got bods like Uma Thurman.<br />
We're known around the world for common sense,<br />
For sausages, Mercedes-Benz.<br />
From the Baltic to the Danube to the Rhine,<br />
We'll apologize for Nineteen-thirty-nine.<br />
So hoist your beer and raise a cheer for<br />
Germany!<br />
Now! Let's! Eat!</p>
