  content: I had not seen this film and found it fascinating. Always the talk of "the
    enemy" which must be found or constructed for these lads to have a job. Anti war?
    Only at the end when he talks about politicians.

<p>This morning I happened upon a mention of <a href="http://www.gwynnedyer.com/">Gwynne Dyer</a>'s 1983 NFB documentary, <a href="http://www.nfb-onf.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=14310">Anybody's Son Will Do</a>. In one succinct hour, it explains the motivation behind military basic training, using intimate footage from the U.S. Marine Corps' notorious <a href="http://www.mcrdpi.usmc.mil/">Paris Island</a> program.</p>
<p>The full documentary is available in piecemeal YouTube-sized portions: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DShDaJXK5qo">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpeqHpyAwe0">part 2</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx_xu5uD9iU">part 3</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0EyKjKAEOM">part 4</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfLE8FLszzU">part 5</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLH5IVJLNgk">part 6</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.countercurrents.org/willers200410.htm">article</a> that first led me to the film seemed convinced that the US military was in some way suppressing the documentary, but I remember viewing it a couple of decades ago, so I guess the suppression didn't reach north of the 49th parallel. Not to mention that the US tends to ignore -- rather than suppress -- any cultural artefact created beyond the borders of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States">Lower 48</a>.</p>
<p>One interesting tidbit, which has the full faith and credit of the intertubes behind it, is that <a href="http://kubrickfilms.tripod.com/id75.html">Dyer's documentary influenced Stanley Kubrick</a>'s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093058/">Full Metal Jacket</a>, or at least up until Pyle shoots the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Lee_Ermey">Gunny</a>.</p>
<p>Like all of Dyer's work -- my favourite military and geopolitical writer -- the film is a matter-of-fact account of what has to be done to young men to make them soldiers. Regardless of what the article contends, it's not an anti-war piece. Just hang-dog Dyer tellin' it like it is.</p>
