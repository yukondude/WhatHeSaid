<p>I was formatting a Microsoft Word document the other day. I use Word's styles as much as possible: I teaches 'em, so I uses 'em. To format the title paragraph, I decided to create a style called...Title.</p>
<p>Now I know there's already a built-in style named Title, but I didn't feel like digging around for it. When I tried to enter Title as the name of my style, Word spat back this error message.</p>
<p><em>Image an error message here because I've lost the original image file.</em></p>
<p>This is exactly the sort of thing that drives me nuts about software. I wanted to do something entirely reasonable -- to my way of thinking -- and rather than let me, or at least guide me toward an acceptable compromise, the program spouted some nonsense that my action was in error.</p>
<p>User's can't make errors. Oh, they can make truly horrific mistakes, just not errors. To see the difference, let's equip our user with another tool, a hammer. The user can smash windows, thumbs, and delicate wood surfaces with the hammer -- all mistakes -- but at no point does the user take a swing at a nail only to be halted in mid-whack by the hammer-generated error: "This nail has already been struck or has been reserved for striking by Microsoft� Hammer�."</p>
<p>So what should Word have done when I entered "Title" as the name of my style? I can think of at least three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let me call it Title, replacing whatever previous definition with that name exists.</li>
<li>Let me call it Title and deactivate or rename the built-in definition in such a way that I can summon it back into existence later if I so choose.</li>
<li>Let me call it Title but make it clear that I am now changing the existing built-in style rather than creating a new one from scratch.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of my suggestions don't let me call the style Title. If that's a mistake, so be it, but Word should accommodate my mistakes. If it must, Word could alert me to the fact that I may be venturing in an unwise direction, preferably by any mechanism other than a modal message box.</p>
<p>Word already accommodates a great many user mistakes through the wonderful Undo feature -- I'd be willing to shell out plenty for Microsoft� Hammer� if it came with Undo -- so why should the Great Title Style Naming episode be any different?</p>
<p>Because (<em>cue violins</em>) it's hard to write programs that don't allow users to make errors. Much harder.</p>
<p>Tough! Microsoft's got some of the best programmers in the world down there in Redmond. If anyone -- especially anyone working in a corporation that spends billions on R&amp;D -- can correct this state of affairs, I'm confident one of the 'serfs can. C'mon guys and gals, we don't need another equivalent-to-tacking-on-a-clock feature: fix the software so that it's impossible for users to make errors. And let them back out of a mistake -- any mistake.</p>
