<p>Google got me.</p>
<p>Oh, I can still muster distrust in that Yankee corporate overlord of the Internet, but it was the spam that finally punched my ticket. Running my own e-mail server lo these past eight years had become a terrible burden. Each week, another thousand exhortations would duck my carefully tuned filters.</p>
<p>Hands held aloft in exasperation, I pledged allegiance to <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/details.html">Google Apps Premier Edition</a>, ceded my <a href="http://yukondude.com/">yukondude.com</a> mail exchange forwards to Gmail's grasping servers, and <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/email_uploader.html">surrendered</a> some seventeen thousand messages dating back to the millennium.</p>
<p>By my calculations, I have another 155 years of indentured mail service before exhausting my quota.</p>
