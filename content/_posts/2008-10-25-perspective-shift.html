<p><em>The title of this post reminded me of my first attempt at the driver's licence examination. I failed for speeding, but returned the next day to argue that, due to <a class="def" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax">parallax</a>, the tester had misread the speedometer from his position: some feet away from the driver in a boat-bodied <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:73newyorkerhtsedan.JPG">1969 Chrysler New Yorker</a>. (The tester may have also observed that when I parked before the test and shut the door, the side mirror fell off.) I was granted a re-test the following week and passed in the midst of a snowstorm.</em></p>
<p>For the past two weeks, I have occupied the position of Manager of Computing Services at Yukon College. I doubt that the <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/10/03/what-i-did-at-the-interview/">Vulcan high-five</a> was solely responsible for my selection.</p>
<p>Prior to that, I had spent one or two days per week maintaining a certain collegiate computer system and fiddling with its reports. I concentrated on moving data from hither to yon and that was about it.</p>
<p>Before, I worried about ones and zeros. Now, I fret over cable and conduit. Before, I carefully adjusted the decimal point. Now, I ignore the pennies and tally the dollars. Before, I focussed on my work, my time, and my results. Now, I focus on nothing, and instead struggle to be aware of everyone and everything.</p>
<p>Having given some thought to the position before applying, I wasn't surprised by the change in perspective, but I can't say that I was prepared for it. Long spells as a team leader in the past didn't help.</p>
<p>It's very early days yet, but I've had an encouraging glimpse of the future. Having a say in said future was the reason I applied in the first place.</p>
