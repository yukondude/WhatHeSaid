<p>I occasionally run into this error when working with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash">bash</a> shell scripts:</p>
<p><code>: bad interpreter: No such file or directory</code></p>
<p>Sometimes the line begins with munged-together directory paths.</p>
<p>The problem is Windows-style CRLF <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline">line-terminators</a> rather than UNIX-friendly LF terminators. A quick run of <code>dos2unix</code> fixes it nicely.</p>
<p>The CRLFs sneak in because I often write and test apps on Windows (<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> to the rescue) and then deploy them to Linux.</p>
