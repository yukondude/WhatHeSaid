<p>Now that I've caught up to the previous decade by getting an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/">iTouch</a> for Christmas (and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reader-Wifi-Graphite/dp/B002Y27P3M/ref=kin3w_ddp_compare_title1">Kindle</a> for my birthday that's stuck in some shipping department somewhere), I realized that this blog was impossible to read on a mobile device. It's merely difficult to read on a desktop computer.</p>
<p>So, I installed the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mobile-pack/">WordPress Mobile Pack plugin</a>, and now it should automatically display a much simplified version if you visit using your mobile doohickey. If not, you can always reach the mobile version atÂ <a href="http://m.whathesaid.ca/">m.whathesaid.ca</a>.</p>
