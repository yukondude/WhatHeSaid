    A better plan would have been to:

    1) post this on the old feed location
    2) put a 304 in at the old URL - many feedreaders will reconfig as required.

    Found you again - no hiding anymore!

<p>I've moved the <a class="def" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss">RSS</a> subscription feed to <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">Feedburner</a>, and this is it's new address:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/WhatHeSaid">http://feeds.feedburner.com/WhatHeSaid</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=WhatHeSaid&amp;loc=en_US">receive What He Said postings by e-mail</a> (images don't seem to be included).</p>
