  content: I agree. On the iPod Touch's display, the singing lady's eyes are too small
    to follow me around the room. They need to be big and googley at all resolutions.

    I like it - you have a future on HGTV... just practise saying, "Clean lines! Minimalist! Zen-like! A blank canvas! A clean palette!"

    You'll need some throw cushions and a debonair/haughty attitude. Really tight pants wouldn't hurt either.

    selection of pastel throw pillows might dull the pain somewhat.

<p>I think a small part of the reason I haven't written much lately is that I had grown weary of this blog's Facebook-like cram-it-in-a-blue-box visual design.</p>
<p>So, I stripped it down to just about the bare minimum, loosely basing its new look on a WordPress theme called <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/clear">Clear</a>. Now the words have elbow room. Space to breathe. <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum">Lebensraum</a></em>, you might even furtively whisper.</p>
<p>Customizing a WordPress theme is a tedious process, and while I'm not done yet, I'll pretend I am for the moment. Ta Da!</p>
<p>For reference, the old gal used to look like this:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><img class="size-full wp-image-1589" title="Ye olde blog theme." src="/heap/what-he-said-old-theme.png" alt="" width="750" height="344"><p>For those without a clear understanding of the F5 or âŒ˜R keys, the blog might still look like this.</p></div>
