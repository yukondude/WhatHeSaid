<p>Carole and I are excited to be attending <del datetime="2010-03-30T00:10:49+00:00">our</del> my first <a href="http://www.dcmf.com/">Dawson City Music Festival</a> this July: the tickets and room are bought and booked.</p>
<p>We then checked out the <a href="http://www.dcmf.com/lineup.html">proposed slate of bands</a>, and if you should happen to open all of the links on that page at once, something like the following will burst forth from your speakers:</p>
<p><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/heap/dcmf-composite.mp3">Twenty-eight ungodly seconds of the 2010 DCMF</a> (630KB MP3)</p>
<p>Listening to 'em all at once is a real time-saver.</p>
<p>Or, if you respond better to an overload of visual stimuli, here are all of the bands' glamour shots stacked one on top of another. Try to spot your faves:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://www.dcmf.com/lineup.html"><img class="size-full wp-image-772" title="The 2010 Dawson City Music Festival lineup." src="/heap/dcmf-composite.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></a><p>This sort of thing would be much more common if the concept of time did not exist.</p></div>
<p>Oh, and why is it that every band has a MySpace page? I though the trend-setters had long ago moved to Facebook. Although, judging by some of the bands' websites, "trend-setting" is far from the correct term when it comes to Internet presence.</p>
