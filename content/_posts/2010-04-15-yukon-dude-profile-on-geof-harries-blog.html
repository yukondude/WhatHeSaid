<p><a href="http://yukondude.com/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-882" title="yukon dude" src="/heap/big-purple-dude.png" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></a>somewhere along the line i decided that <a href="http://yukondude.com/">my little company</a>'s title would also be little, and so i always spell it in lowercase. that makes it especially difficult to begin a sentence with.</p>
<p>anyway, <a href="http://gdharries.com/">geof harries</a> just posted a <a href="http://gdharries.com/blog/archive/yukon-setups-rogers">profile of yukon dude</a> on his blog. thanks, geof.</p>
<p>boy, it's high time that i updated the company's site. especially now that i've dropped the "software" part from the name.</p>
