<p>There is a school of web design, beloved by news organizations, that lives by the motto "that space can be filled." To these folks, white pixels are a lost opportunity cost.</p>
<p>Every so often, I come across browser plug-ins that promise to cleanse these sardined pages, but each one has some unpardonable fault: missing text, choppy layout, inconsistent font size, or -- Heavens to Betsy! -- advertisements.</p>
<p>Last week I found <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a>, a clever snippet of JavaScript that can be used from any browser as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a>. Someone has also written convenient Readability add-ons for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jggheggpdocamneaacmfoipeehedigia?hl=en">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/46442/">Firefox</a>.</p>
<p>In short, Readability takes pretty much any complex web page, extracts the main story text, and presents it in a simple format of your choosing. <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/2009/03/02/readability/">This announcement explains the concept and demonstrates it in action with a video</a>.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following eye-gouging article presentation. We know there must be a story in there somewhere. On the left side, maybe?</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100526134039.htm"><img class="size-full wp-image-1007" title="Before Readability" src="/heap/before-readability.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="298" /></a><p>You know what would really spruce up this page? Dancing leprechauns, for starters.</p></div>
<p>With a quick click of the Readability button, the article is transformed:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1008" title="After Readability" src="/heap/after-readability.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="294" /></a><p>Martha, I do believe I&#039;ll take my pi√±a colada on the south terrace.</p></div>
<p>An article that you can actually read. On the internet, no less. I thought I'd never see the day.</p>
