<p>All it takes is two photographs. At first glance, which group do you think knows what it's talking about?</p>
<h3>Exhibit A: CBC National "At Issue" Panel</h3>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/heap/at-issue-plus-rex.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1426" title="The best thing on at about 10:30 on Thursdays. Unless APTN is showing yet another Val Kilmer flick." src="/heap/at-issue-plus-rex.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></a><p>Gregg, HÃ©bert (back in the &quot;good&quot; haircut days), Pastor Mansbridge, Coyne, and occasional grandiloquent guest, Popeye Rex.</p></div>
<h3>Exhibit B: Fox &amp; Friends</h3>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/heap/fox-and-friends.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1427" title="Never have seen it. Never will." src="/heap/fox-and-friends.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="326" /></a><p>Fascist Twinkie, Autocrat Twinkie, Reactionary Twinkie, and Parochial Twinkie.</p></div>
<p>I'll say this for the Yanks, they give good smile.</p>
