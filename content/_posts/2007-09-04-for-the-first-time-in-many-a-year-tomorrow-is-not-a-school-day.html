    that doesn't involve code or keyboards.

    than I'm used to.

<p>As befits the approach of mid-life, I'm starting something new this fall. Thing is, I don't exactly know what that will be. What it won't be is something at <a href="http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/">Yukon College</a>: neither teaching nor computing.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for my leaving the College, paramount of which is the answer to this question:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I look back in five years time, will I be glad that I chose well-paying system maintenance in a windowless basement?</p></blockquote>
<p>Teaching is a separate issue. Unfortunately, <a href="/2007/04/29/whither-the-computing-students/">there just aren't enough students</a>. Not for <a href="http://college.yukondude.com/">what I teach</a>, anyhow. While I could keep my hand in for one course per term, that's too low a job-satisfaction-per-unit-union-nonsense ratio for my tastes.</p>
<p>No, it's to be a clean break from the College for me. That is, after one more month of part-time contract work in the aforementioned basement. Then begins a German course I've had my eye on. Perhaps even a spot of welding next spring.</p>
<p>My "something new" may just be a career as a Mercedes mechanic. I know of at least one in the Territory -- and wouldn't you know it -- it's usually parked at the College.</p>
