<p>They're finally making a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1075747/">movie</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah_Hex">Jonah</a>, and, yes, that's the synopsis of the plot. A plot concerning neither his postbellum nor his post-apocalyptic exploits. Instead, the source material is a little known 1990s mini-series in which our holey-cheeked gunslinger scuffles with zombies. My brother got into a scuffle of his own with an Ottawa Comic Book Guy over this very issue.</p>
<p>Of course, with John Malkovich aboard, this thing might just stand a chance.</p>
