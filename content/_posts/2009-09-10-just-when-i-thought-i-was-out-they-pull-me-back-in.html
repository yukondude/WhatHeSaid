<p>By my count, I've quit jobs at Yukon College <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/09/04/for-the-first-time-in-many-a-year-tomorrow-is-not-a-school-day/">twice</a> <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2009/07/02/manager-no-more/">before</a>. So the fact that I start teaching a class this afternoon must mean that I'm a very bad quitter.</p>
<p>"Poor quitting skills," it reads on my permanent file. "Shows a marked inability to resign, abdicate, decamp, vacate, withdraw, knock off, terminate, desist, or just plain give over already. Criminy."</p>
<p>My yo-yo relationship with the College makes it a little unnerving to enter the building. Fortunately, I have a course to absorb all of my attention. It's well within my competency to teach one or two courses. Beyond that, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Principle">Peter Principle</a> takes effect.</p>
<p>So, while it is true that I am wholly and singularly to blame for any and all mistakes made before and because I quit, I take heart that I am not to blame for the many more mistakes that would've surely been made had I not quit. I mean, had I not quit that second time, after that first time I quit but before I unquit the time before this. Or something.</p>
