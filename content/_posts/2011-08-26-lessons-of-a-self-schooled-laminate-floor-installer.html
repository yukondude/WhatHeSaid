Having already learned to install linoleum, carpet, tile, and decking, I must first admit that it was very wrong to have layered them in that order: carpet should always go <em>on top</em> of the tile, with but a subtle linoleum layer as the finisher. That's the true secret to replicating bouncy castle foot-feel.</p>
<p>This year's never-ending renovation project included a complete resurfacing of the bottom-most portion of the kitchen and living room. This time we chose laminate flooring, a high-pressure sandwich of wood-grain stickers, ballpark peanut shells, and refinery scrapings. Also sandwiches. Together with the look and feel of real wood, you also get the satisfaction of having reallocated a measure of the planet's industrial toxin supply.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/05/31"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1731" title="All credit to Bill Watterson, in lieu of actual licence payments." src="/heap/handy-expletives.png" alt="" width="141" height="126" /></a>We chose a warm and cheerful interpretation of maple, but many other species are available: balsa, Dutch elm, baobab, and something new called OakALike®.</p>
<p>Installing laminate flooring is widely advertised as a novice do-it-yourself-er's weekend project. And that's true. It's also true that a novice won't do nearly as good a job as an experienced floorwright. As evidence, I submit exhibit A, the ground fault circuit interrupter that trips randomly when a certain electrical novice's bathroom fan is turned off.</p>
<p>However, having now completed a full laminate installation with the aid of my able nephew, it is with no little authority that I proclaim the following hard-earned lessons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tap the rectangular puck thingy gently -- always along the longer side, if possible -- to avoid chipping the delicate top layer of the planks.</li>
<li>Always buy a few extra boxes of planks. Once emptied, you can use these to store planks with chipped edges.</li>
<li>Most laminate floors are "floating," meaning that all of your careful measurements will be for naught after returning from your lunch break.</li>
<li>The spacers used to reserve an expansion gap around the perimeter are engineered to fall down if looked at, and will also chip the delicate top layer of the planks.</li>
<li>Your two most useful self assurances will be: "Oh, we'll just put an extra piece of quarter-round moulding on that wall," and "This'll be a perfect spot for a throw rug."</li>
<li>Planks are randomly assorted into their boxes, so when you randomly sort them as they're removed, probability theory will reward you with a perfect, repeating, wallpaper effect.</li>
<li>The claw-like gadget used to pull planks tight from a finished end should ideally be employed only by people without fingers. That, or use a Nerf hammer.</li>
<li>Proper pre-location of floor register vents is essential to avoiding a rash of "guess holes." You may simply have to resign yourself to bordering all registers with throw rugs.</li>
<li>Gaps that later appear between planks can be remedied by not looking at them.</li>
<li>A proper fine-bladed power mitre saw and table saw will produce the best cuts, but working the plank guillotine device loaned by the store is wonderfully cathartic.</li>
<li>A plank with a chipped edge can be recycled for an end piece, just not the end piece that you cut it for.</li>
<li>Careful measurement will always ensure that your last row of planks has to be cut to a width of 3/8ths of an inch.</li>
</ul>
<p>As wrong as it seems to actually walk upon a newly finished laminate floor, try your hardest to do so. For the bravest among you, I even encourage a brief victory jig:</p>
