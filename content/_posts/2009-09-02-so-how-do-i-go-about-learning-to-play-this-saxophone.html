    The All City Band (junior or senior depending on your level - Bruce or Rebekah can help you decide) is a good start.

    I'll ask around about the one-on-one lessons.

    their right hand stuck up where the sun don't shine. I don't trust 'em.

<p>I was lucky enough to acquire a tenor saxophone -- thanks Mom! -- this summer. So far, I've been squawking away at home only while the neighbours are at work. The bathroom has wicked acoustics.</p>
<p>But now I need to get better at this thing. I was a reasonably good clarinet and sax player back in high school, playing the baritone in our senior swing band for various paid and unpaid gigs, including a ball in the West Block's <a href="http://www.collineduparlement-parliamenthill.gc.ca/histoire-history/ouest-west/confederation-eng.html">Confederation Room</a> on Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>But that was a quarter-century ago (OMG!) and in the time since, my embouchure, breath control, fingering, and music reading skills have hit the skids. I'll be looking into the <a href="http://www.allcityband.com/">All City Band</a> shortly -- although with trepidation, 'cause I really suck at the moment, but remember being so much better. I'm also heading down to the music store later to look at the bulletin board.</p>
<p>In the meantime, does anyone know of saxophone lessons offered about town, or have suggestions for this fledgling saxophonist?</p>
