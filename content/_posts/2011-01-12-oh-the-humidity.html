  content: Oh, Dave!  How DO you manage to make such mundane topics so hilarious?  I'm
    glad that poor dehumidifier found a good home and is being well-fed.

  content: What I didn't mention is that we also have a humidifier. What I do is take
    out the water from the dehumidifier and pour it into the humidifier at the other
    end of the house. My goal is to create a thundercloud in the hallway.

<p>I once <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/12/06/im-trying-to-find-an-air-conditioner-in-the-yukon-in-december/">tried to find an air conditioner in December</a>. This winter, in the same month, I tried for a dehumidifier.</p>
<p>Not easy to find in the Yukon, those. The back wall of Canadian Tire has stacks upon racks of humidifiers, but very little selection of the "de-" variety. Desperate to foist off the ones they did have, I got a one-third discount.</p>
<p>This house doesn't breathe properly. For one thing, I've never, ever, not once had a static electric shock in the place, summer or winter. But when condensation started building up on the back walls of the closet, I figured there was a problem.</p>
<p>The dehumidifier now hisses away in its corner, sucking a few litres of water out of the air each day, and yet I still can't summon a spark by scuffling along on the carpet.</p>
<p>How different from my youth in Ottawa, where winter was generally spent dodging metal in the apartment. Except for that one time I got brand new cross-country skis and thought I'd try them out first on the living room carpet. After a few in-place strides, I took them off and reached to turn off the room's lights.</p>
<p>About the last thing I remember of that incident was a three-foot blue bolt that led from my fingertip to the light switch plate screw.</p>
