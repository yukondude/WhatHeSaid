<p>I deleted my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> account this morning. Which is to say I unsubscribed from my groups and networks, erased my friends, and deactivated the account -- you can't actually delete your account (<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Permanently-Delete-a-Facebook-Account">without first creating a new account that itself can't be deleted</a>).</p>
<p>I was never much into Facebook to begin with. I find social networks very interesting, all except for the socializing part. In much the same way, I'm fascinated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_radio" class="def">ham radio</a>: all of those knobs to twist and wires to solder and antennae to twiddle. But then you have to actually talk to someone.</p>
<p>No thanks.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes after my deactivation, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/go/">CBC Radio's GO</a> devotes an episode to Facebook. That must surely be the sign of a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7257073.stm">spiralling trend to oblivion</a>.</p>
