<p>I've been waking at 3am every day for a month or so to take the puppy out for her mid-night business. Somehow appropriate for a dog named <em><a href="http://en.bab.la/dictionary/french-english/minuit">Minuit</a></em>.</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MfisiGqtEM#t=0m33s"><img class=" " title="No, we didn't have videogames. Instead we had this. And Spider-Man. And Hercules. And Battle of the Planets. And Captain Nemo. 'Twas a wondrous age." src="http://mimg.ugo.com/201005/43608/cuts/1966-rocket-robin-hood_288x288.jpg" alt="" width="184" height="184" /></a><p>Rocket Robin Hood and &quot;Missiles&quot; Maid Marian</p></div>
<p>Rising from sleep at that hour seems to lock random bits of dream into my conscious, usually in an ever-repeating loop.</p>
<p>Last night's random bit was a ditty I composed many, many years ago for a <a href="http://www.goldenwords.net/">small university humour publication</a>. And now it's stuck in my head.</p>
<p>Better it be stuck in yours. Here it is in entirety. Sung, for some unfathomable reason, to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MfisiGqtEM#t=0m33s">chorus from the Rocket Robin Hood theme song</a>.</p>
<p><em>We are German. We speak German.</em><br />
<em>We've got bods like Uma Thurman.</em><br />
<em>We're known around the world for common sense,</em><br />
<em>For sausages, Mercedes Benz.</em><br />
<em>From the Baltic to the Danube to the Rhine,</em><br />
<em>We'll apologize for nineteen thirty nine.</em><br />
<em>So hoist your beer and raise a cheer for...</em><br />
<em>Germany! Now! Let's! Eat! </em></p>
<p>Tomorrow's 3am gift from me to you: one can sing the lyrics of <em>Rule, Britannia!</em> to the tune of <em>Oh! Susanna</em>, and vice versa.</p>
