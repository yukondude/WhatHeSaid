    left behind by retreating winter make their way out of Canis Miserabile

<p>Three years of high-school Latin, and that's the best I can do. Still, slapping a dead language on a throwaway phrase like, oh, let's say, "the dog that ate something horrible," does lend it a more rarefied cachet.</p>
<p>This week's thaw has really brought out the smells of the trail. <a href="http://yukonchatterbug.wordpress.com/2007/02/09/home-your-dogs-castle-or-doghouse/">Smidgen</a> zigzags along the paths, luxuriating in the wafting odours.</p>
<p>Then she eats whatever might be the source of that smell.</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind so much if she could just keep it down. Dogs that will gobble up anything the City of Whitehorse deems compostable shouldn't come equipped with a stomach made of eggshell. At least she's regular: six o'clock in the morning seems to be the heaving hour. There's no need for coffee after that emergency lurch to the back door to evacuate your erupting pet.</p>
<p><em>If you can improve on the translation, please don't hesitate to educate me. Learning Latin is, after all, a licence to forcibly improve others' grammar -- in any language.</em></p>
