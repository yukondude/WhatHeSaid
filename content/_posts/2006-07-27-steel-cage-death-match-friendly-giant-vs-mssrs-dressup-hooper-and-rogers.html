<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Friendly_Giant">Friendly</a> wins hands down. The three misters would just have enough time to look up, waaaay up, at their foe before he grabbed all three by the scruffs of their necks and scrunched them together into a little ball. Then, with the greatest of ease, he'd mash their broken bodies into the bigger chair by the fire, leaving the rocking chair in the middle free for someone who likes to rock. </p>
