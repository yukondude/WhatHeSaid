  content: Thank-you, thank-you. If enough people click the Google search results
    link, the folks at SCT will start wondering why the keyword "execrable" has become
    so closely associated with their execrable product.

    Upon reflection, I might've preferred another term, but maybe if I keep at it I can get just the word "<a href="http://www.sct.com/Education/products/p_b_index.html" rel="nofollow">execrable</a>" to do the same job.

    By all means, add the same link to your own pages. The more, the merrier when it comes to Google bombing.

<p>Persistent readers of What He Said will have noticed my penchant for referring to the computerized behemoth that runs <a href="http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/">Yukon College</a> as the "<a href="http://www.sct.com/Education/products/p_b_index.html">execrable system</a>."</p>
<p>That I used precisely the same terminology and hyperlink target <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/05/18/a-spoon-full-of-programming-makes-the-medicine-go-down/">over</a> and <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/12/18/no-seriously-big-time-it-contracting-opportunities-at-the-college/">over</a> and <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/01/25/when-not-to-use-a-relational-database-generating-html/">over</a> <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/02/18/when-not-to-use-a-relational-database-generating-html-for-real-this-time/">again</a> was not accidental. I was working on a <a class="def" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlebomb">Google bomb</a>: gradually training the search engine to use my link's text as the official description of the page to which I was linking.</p>
<p>The result?</p>
<p><img src="/heap/execrable-system.gif" alt="Execrable System" width="488" height="238" /></p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=execrable%20system&amp;hl=en&amp;meta=">Try it yourself</a>.)</p>
<p>Didn't take nearly as long as I would've thought. I also made into the top two on <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=execrable%20system&amp;ei=UTF-8">Yahoo!</a> and <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=execrable%20system">Windows Live</a>.</p>
<p>It may not last, but I am well and truly <a class="def" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chuffed">chuffed</a> at the moment.</p>
<h3>Update, April 14</h3>
<p>The execrable system has fallen from the top spot on Google -- my posting actually rates higher -- but it now tops the Yahoo! and Live search results.</p>
