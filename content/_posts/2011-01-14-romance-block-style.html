  content: I love it!  You've got to use it as a prop in your soon-to-be play.  If
    you glue it all together, who cares if it falls over?  Because why would you ever
    want to take it apart? Awww.

  content: I'm surprised he didn't mention the "placement of the boobs" which is something
    he pointed out to me after mentioning the eye colour and height thing. But then
    again, he didn't have the parental warning.

<p>While this does fall into the category Saccharine Cutesy-wootsy, I'm still rather proud of my sculpture, "Smoochers", presented to Carole  on Christmas morning.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1477" title="Smoochers from the left." src="/heap/smoochers-1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="613" /></p>
<p>Note the correct eye colour and correction for height using the old tippy-toe-on-shoe technique. Many of the pieces are dented with my eight-year-old toothmarks.</p>

<p>Now if only slight gusts of wind, such as those from an exhale from twenty paces, didn't disintegrate the thing.</p>
