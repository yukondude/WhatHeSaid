<p><img class="alignleft" title="Live long and prosper." src="http://content8.flixster.com/question/37/45/89/3745890_std.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="192" />I had my first interview in many a year this morning. I have no earthly idea how it went though. It seemed as though I spent most of it floating above myself watching a manic interviewee ramble disjointedly through various hypothetical situations.</p>
<p>But if nothing else, I did manage to answer one conflict-of-interest question by means of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_salute">Vulcan Salute</a>, while declaring an eternal truth: "The good of the many outweighs the good of the few, or the one."</p>
<p>So that made it a pretty good interview.</p>
