<p>I funded most of my university career by hawking musical instruments, surfing my many credit cards (i.e., paying one with another), and accumulating an impressive student loan. I do remember the leaden weight of that debt, and I recognized it in <em>Maxed Out</em> (found via <a href="http://bestdocumentaries.blogspot.com/">Best Free Documentaries</a>). While I like to believe we thrifty Canadians won't be as affected as the film's American victims by ridiculous credit enticements, I don't see any minor cultural distinctions interfering in the pursuit of profit.</p>

I also had to constantly jiggle the progress slider to get the video to play for more than five minutes at a stretch. Why must Internet video be so difficult?)</p>
