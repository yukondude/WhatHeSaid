  content: LOL - unfortunately, though, it's seldom clear anymore whether comments
    like that are Zen, an ESL student writing tech manuals, or part of Bill Gates'
    master plan to make us all crazy.

    Judging by the rest of the support documents, I'm leaning toward a non-English robot's output fed through <a href="http://www.google.com/translate_t" rel="nofollow">Google Translate</a>.

    It is fun to pronounce the 7-letter system identifiers though. I call that one "tuh-BRAP-el". There's also "TIG-ger-feed" and "SPRAY-den", to name just a couple.

<p>While debugging an errant process in the College's <a href="http://www.sct.com/Education/products/p_b_index.html">execrable system</a> this afternoon, I found this passage in a technical support bulletin from the manufacturer:</p>
<blockquote><p> "After step 1 is complete; which the system will not allow you to<br />
accomplish completely; all the TBRAPPL transactions should have a<br />
reapply indicator of Y. Â We know this will not be the case in your<br />
situation."</p></blockquote>
<p>It's a fricken' Zen koan: the true completeness is that which is incomplete; that which should be is that which will not be.</p>
