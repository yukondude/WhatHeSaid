    Why no comments??  I am you mother.  I can comment
    On the subject of babies, they are cute sometimes, they smell good sometimes, they like you sometimes and when you are old they take care of you.

<p>If I'm going to scan one <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/07/17/yet-more-bicycle-storage-foofaraw/">90s-era sock puppet cartoon</a>, I might as well scan two:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="The making of a simile." src="/heap/making-of-a-simile.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="529" /></p>
<p>Funny or not, I just love googly eyes.</p>
