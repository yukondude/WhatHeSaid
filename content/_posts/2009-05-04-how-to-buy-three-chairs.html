    Your post is funny, but what's even funnier is the Friendly Green Giant furniture set. So awesome.

    Rusty the chicken still scares me.

    (<em>Whoops. Geof, I think you've commingled the CBC's Friendly Giant with the niblet-picking Jolly Green Giant.</em>)

    I fondly remember the episodes in which the raccoons showed up for jam sessions.

    "Recorder Solo!"

<p>On March 5th I got a note that one of the computer labs in the <a href="http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/">College</a> was minus three chairs. They were borrowed or mangled or misplaced or had succumbed to any one of a hundred other misfortunes that can afflict the modern office chair.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/antifreez/102680143/"><img class="alignright" title="... and a bigger chair for two to curl up in" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/41/102680143_26f622d743.jpg" alt="" width="250" style="margin-left:10px" /></a></p>
<p>As the person ultimately responsible for the computer labs, it fell to me to order their replacements.</p>
<p>Now I should tell you: I had never ordered a chair before. Oh, I could order computers blindfolded, and network switches on tiptoe, and even drafting software while downing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagwood_sandwich">dagwood</a>, but never a chair. So each and every one of the following bureaucratic bungles are either beyond the realm of mortal control, or are entirely my fault.</p>
<p>My three-chair order eventually required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two requisition submissions;</li>
<li>One requisition denial for incorrect account numbers;
</li>
<li>One requisition denial for falling under the low value purchase limit;
</li>
<li>One requisition resubmission after the total of the three exceeded the low value limit;</li>
<li>Three minutes of on-site visit by...</li>
<li>Two office furniture company representatives to determine the correct chair model (I described them on the phone as "bendy, black, and with elbow platforms");</li>
<li>One discovery that this precise chair model was on back-order; and
</li>
<li>One last-minute purchase order cancellation because the purchase order had already been issued by a different department a week earlier.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The chairs arrived today, May 4th, just a hair under two months after the initial request. Now I just have to assemble them.</p>
<p>How long could that take?</p>
