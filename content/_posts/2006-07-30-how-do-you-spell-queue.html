<p>We were exploring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type" class="def">abstract data types</a> one day in class, when a student looked up from his notes and asked, "How do you spell '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue" class="def">queue</a>'?"</p>
<p>"Oh that's easy," I answered, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO" class="def">F-I-F-O</a>."</p>
<p>He failed to see the humour.</p>
