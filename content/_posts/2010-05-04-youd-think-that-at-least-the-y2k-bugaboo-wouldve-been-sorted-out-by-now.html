<p>I was clearing out some receipts earlier today and found this.</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><img class="size-full wp-image-928" title="1910 Receipt" src="/heap/1910-cash-machine.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185"><p>Adjusting for inflation, my withdrawal could&#039;ve financed the second Boer War.</p></div>
<p>At the time, I do remember thinking that the Automatronic Currency Disburserator was an older model:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><img class="size-full wp-image-931" title="1910 Cash Machine" src="/heap/1910-abm.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="548"><p>&quot;Your $1.50 service charge will help defray the cost of my gilding.&quot;</p></div>
