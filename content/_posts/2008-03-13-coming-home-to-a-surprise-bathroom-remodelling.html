<p>Apparently, March Break gives teachers too much time at home for contemplating renovation. After four whole days off, the tired flower print lining the bathroom fell under Carole's gaze.</p>
<p>But to be honest, once the wallpaper was stripped, it was my idea to pull up the old flooring. Somehow that spread to the complete removal of a wall, the linen closet, and the right side of the vanity.</p>
<p>We've easily halved the distance from the home office to the toilet; they're effectively in the same room. For all you know, this is being written on the potty.</p>
