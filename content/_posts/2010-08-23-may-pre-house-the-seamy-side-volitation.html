<p>Years ago, my brother sent me a flying Astroboy toy from Korea. I never quite figured out what to do with it, but I did look up the instructions online. While cleaning out some old folders this morning, I came across those very instructions:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><img class="size-full wp-image-1172" title="Saiyan Weild Ways And Means" src="/heap/SaiyanWeildWaysAndMeans.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="908"><p>Of course, Asian folks probably scream with laughter at the instructions we translate for them.</p></div>
<p>In my opinion, there just aren't enough manuals featuring the phrase "Til the cowcomes home."</p>
<p>Strangely, I never did get Astroboy to fly. Prythee, must've skipped a tatelage somewhere.</p>
