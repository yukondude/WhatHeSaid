<p>It's been just shy of a decade since I first rolled into the territory. That's a decade of Outsiders asking "why'd you go way up there anyway?" I have many canned replies: pace, wilderness, community, challenge, atmosphere, and getting as far away as possible from you inquisitive buggers.</p>
<p>But I think there's one secret reason that newcomers prefer not to acknowledge: "The Yukon" is a frickin' cool name.</p>
<p>First off, anything that begins with "the" is awesome: The Hague, The Hulk, The Who.</p>
<p>Then there's the word "Yukon"; a word imbued with mystery, remoteness, treasure, the feral soul of the uncivil adventurer, and, well, cold.</p>
<p>Any name like that is gold to marketers. But "Yukon" is inevitably misused for products that have no earthly relationship with our triangular territory.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.homedepot.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogSearchResultView?D=937036&amp;Ntt=937036&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;langId=-15&amp;storeId=10051&amp;Dx=mode+matchallpartial&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall&amp;recN=0&amp;N=0&amp;Ntk=P_PartNumber"><img class="size-medium wp-image-366 alignleft" style="margin-right:10px" title="Yukon 'Oak'" src="/heap/yukon-oak-300x92.jpg" alt="Yukon 'Oak'" width="300" height="92" /></a></p>
<p>For example, while <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2009/08/27/so-youre-going-to-drive-to-the-yukon/">visiting Ontario</a> this summer, I ran across a display of "Yukon Oak" flooring at a Home Depot in Timmins. It seems to be a blondish shade of regular oak.</p>
<p>Dear plank purchaser: don't be deceived. There are no oaks in the Yukon. There aren't even trees large enough to pretend to be oaks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.starbucks.com/coffee/b226-the-bear-is-back.aspx"><img class="size-full wp-image-368 alignright" style="margin-left:10px" title="Yukon Blend" src="/heap/starbucks-yukon-blend.jpg" alt="Yukon Blend" width="140" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>A hasty googling suggests that "<a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=yukon+oak&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=">Yukon Oak</a>" only exists within the realm of laminate flooring.</p>
<p>And who among us has not smirked at a coffee shop down south advertising its Yukon or Klondike blend?</p>
<p>To be sure, there are at least two excellent <a href="http://www.beannorth.com/">coffee</a> <a href="http://www.midnight-sun-coffee.com/">roasting</a> companies in the Yukon. But their raw beans are shipped from very, very far away. For some durned reason, coffee plants don't take to our mountainsides.</p>
<p><em>Funny, he never asks for a second cup of Kluane Koffee at home!</em></p>
<p>Let's not forget the <a href="http://www.rrochat.com/akcc/">Alaska Klondike Coffee Company</a>, which packages two misdirections into its Missouri-headquartered title.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gm.ca/gm/english/vehicles/gmc/yukon/overview"><img class="size-medium wp-image-360 alignleft" style="margin-right:10px" title="GMC Yukon Denali" src="/heap/gmc-yukon-denali-300x160.jpg" alt="GMC Yukon Denali" width="300" height="160" /></a>Then there's the <a href="http://www.gm.ca/gm/english/vehicles/gmc/yukon/model03">GMC Yukon Denali enviro-nuker</a>. Leaving aside the pesky detail that <a href="http://www.nps.gov/dena/index.htm">Denali is actually in Alaska</a>, there is no component, part, or accessory of this pavement pounder that is designed, manufactured, or assembled in the Yukon.</p>
<p>There are, it must be said, a fair number of these luxuriously appointed cinder-blocks trundling about the territory. Strange that we don't see them sharing the Alaska highway with Ford Oshawas, Chrysler Michigans, or Toyota Woodstocks. I guess those names just aren't tongue-rolling material.</p>
<p>There's no shortage of these products that just ain't Yukon. More to follow...</p>
