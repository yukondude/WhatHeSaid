<p style="text-align: center"><em>Maniacal [common: muh-NEYE-uh-kul, Carole: MAIN-ee-ah-kul]<br />
adj. Of or pertaining to a maniac.</em></p>
<p>My Carole is as bilingual as one can be in French and English. It's as if the Leafs and Habs hooked up and had a baby girl. English speakers might be able to detect a slight un-placeable  accent, and French speakers can tell that she is from outside Québec -- either Ontario or New Brunswick -- but both languages sound native. This is just one of the benefits of being raised in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timmins">Timmins</a>, a town that is actually trilingual: English, French, and Shania.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Groin [common: GROYN, Carole: GROW-in]<br />
n. The fold where the thighs join the abdomen.</em></p>
<p>And yet she is utterly mystified by the pronunciation of certain English words. The problem is usually in deciding which syllable to emphasize. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics)#Placement.2C_rhythm.2C_and_metrical_feet">French doesn't stress syllables</a> in the same way as English, and it also has all sorts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_orthography#Diacritics">little decorative ticks on the letters</a> to aid pronunciation. She's less likely to use French pronunciation rules on English words the way many francophones do, but that does happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Horizon [common: ho-REYE-zun, Carole: HORE-ih-zon]<br />
n. The boundary between the earth and sky.</em></p>
<p>Most unilingual English speakers also have difficulty with these words, a result of the language's  near complete disregard for rules when it comes to grammar, spelling, and pronunciation. Even I, the son of a linguist and a librarian, must confess trouble with "eschew", "salve", and "facetious", to name just a few.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Stir [common: STUR, Carole: STEER]<br />
v.t. To move an implement repeatedly through a substance to agitate it.</em></p>
<p>When Carole stumbles over these, I occasionally try to point out that French is similarly disorganized when it comes to deciding whether to <em>le</em> or <em>la</em> arbitrary nouns, but more often than not I apologize for English's endless exceptions. She almost always comes close enough to be understandable anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Melancholy [common: MEL-un-call-ee, Carole: mul-ANK-oh-lee]<br />
n. A gloomy state of mind.</em></p>
<p>Oh dear. Now I'm feeling a little mulankohlee.</p>
