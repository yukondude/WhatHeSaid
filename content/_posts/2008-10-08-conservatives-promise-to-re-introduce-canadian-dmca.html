<p>According to their finally-released platform, the Tories intend to reintroduce the <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/06/12/canadian-dmca-is-wor.html">Canadian DMCA</a> bill formerly known as <a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=3570473&amp;file=4">C-61</a> (it would get a new number in the new parliament). I'm not inclined to link to the Conservatives' website for the details, and in any case <code>conservative.ca</code> seems to be down at the moment. I've written before about this bill and its punitive intentions.</p>
<p>As usual, <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/3439/125/">Michael Geist has the complete story</a>, and also the credit for my posting's title.</p>
<p>Don't want a DMCA north of 60° (or 49° for that matter)? Then keep Daryl P. home after the 14<sup>th</sup>, and away from his pal Stephen in Ottawa. Oh, there's lots of reasons to shove the Conservatives over to the left of the Speaker, but this seems as good a one as any.</p>
