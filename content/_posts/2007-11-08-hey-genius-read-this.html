  content: I've got the same problem as you.  Perhaps we should get Geoff to develop
    a new site called "urbanyukon4geniuses.com".

    I wonder what the Blog Readability Test algorithm is. I assume it's something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch-Kincaid_Readability_Test" rel="nofollow">Flesch-Kincaid</a> which is based on the number of words per sentence and the number of syllables per word.

    Speaking for myself, I think they set the "genius" bar a little low.

    Oh yeah, speaking for me and my Elementary school cronies "my dad can beat up your dad!" :)

    superior to your sire! Huzzah!"'

<p>I spotted Andrew Stark's "<a href="http://www.astarkmagazine.com/blog/2007/11/7/how-accessible-is-your-blog.html">How Accessible is Your Blog</a>" posting on <a href="http://www.urbanyukon.com/">Urban Yukon</a> and just had to see what the <a href="http://www.criticsrant.com/bb/reading_level.aspx">Blog Readability Test</a> had to say about What He Said:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.criticsrant.com/bb/reading_level.aspx"><img src="http://www.criticsrant.com/bb/readinglevel/img/genius.jpg" style="border: medium none" alt="Genius Reading Level" /></a></p>
<p>Well, that would explain the dearth of readers this blog attracts. Of course, it may just be that my score was artificially raised by the inclusion of <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/11/05/programming-language-scrabble/">958 esoteric programming terms</a>. That, or my pretentious sesquipedalian affectation.</p>
<h3>Update, Dec. 4</h3>
<p>Apparently I've dumbed-down of late and now only earn a High-School rating. Phew, that's a load off.</p>
