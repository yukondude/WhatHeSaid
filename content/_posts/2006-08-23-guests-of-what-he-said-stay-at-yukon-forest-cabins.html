<p>Carole and I spent our last pre-class weekend (actually, there's still one more to go, but that's the traditional "pre-class panic weekend") in a cabin just south of town run by <a href="http://www.yukonforestcabins.com/">Yukon Forest Cabins</a>. A sign that the vacation is off to a fine start is when you find a chocolate-chip bundt cake waiting in the cabin.</p>
<p>Fondue for two at the <a href="http://www.wolfsden.yk.ca/">Wolf's Den</a> capped a day of lazy trail hikes and a dip for the dog in <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=60.5858,+-134.7688&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=60.585787,-134.768772&amp;spn=0.040298,0.173035&amp;t=h&amp;om=1">Shadow Lake</a>.</p>
<p>So, while visiting/escaping Whitehorse, give one of the forest cabins a try. Just be sure to avoid the <a href="http://www.shadowlake.ca/">snooty neighbours</a>.</p>
