    I love it!  Being at the new year, I missed that one in the TDWTF.  Nice to catch it now :)

    p.s. it was 14C outside today :)

<p><a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">The Daily WTF</a> recently posted an entry named "<a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The-Mostest-Wrong-Datatype.aspx">The Mostest Wrong Datatype</a>" which seems -- pure coincidence, surely -- to refer to a local programmer of your acquaintance.</p>
<p>The WTF site highlights examples of confused, inexplicable, or just plain awful programming code. (If you're not of the technical persuasion, you may still enjoy the <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Series/Error_0x27_d.aspx">Error'd</a> portion of the site, which features amusing shots of bewildering computer screens.)</p>
<p>By the way, if you happen to be one of the contractors named in the piece: <em>a pox on your house!</em></p>
