<p>What a lovely day to return to the Territory. I should've been back late last night, but a sudden soggy snow squall in Ottawa stranded the airplane on the runway for five hours. The Air Canada staff made the wait almost bearable -- with free drinks, good humour, and frequent women's hockey gold medal updates -- and also booked me on this morning's flight north and even put me up in an airport hotel in Vancouver for the night. Quite a feat considering the matter of that trifling sporting event going on down there at the moment.</p>
<p>Now its time to relax for a couple of days, and then re-start the year from scratch.</p>
<p>Many thanks to those who passed along <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2010/02/03/and-now-a-personal-note-from-toronto/">condolences</a> to Carole and me. Much appreciated.</p>
<p>A point in favour of small northern homes over larger southern ones: no hot water tap is ever that far from the water heater.</p>
