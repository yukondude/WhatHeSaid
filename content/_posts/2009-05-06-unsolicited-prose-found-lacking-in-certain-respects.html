<p>I received the following unsolicited offering of prose via electronic lettermail this very day, formatted much the way you see it here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">i am so grateful for quiet time with the scriptures.<br />
1. in the craft room i throw everything on the homework table. that clears up the floor for more mess craft making.<br />
What are your tips for clearing clutter so you can focus on such a project as sewing?" well mary, let me answer your question by showing you</p>
<p style="text-align: left">some examples of how i deal with clutter in different areas of my home:</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><em>and totally not what you are supposed to be eating</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">ps- did i say i would sew this past saturday? i meant next saturday! haha!<br />
pps- our topic of convo for the night was this article from the wall street journal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, at this early point, I began to lose faith in the narrative. There is sewing. There is craft-making. There is a clutter that Mary is unwilling or unable to tidy. But the references to her poor diet and the financial media are most distracting. And how would one deliberate upon the scriptures in the midst of such exclaimed week-end frivolity?</p>
<p>The tale continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>i found that amazing old shirt (we're big fans) at the thrift store for $1 and it's so soft. sel<br />
i told cate about st. patrick's day and ireland- she has a lot of irish ancestors through me.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">but so worth it.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">it's definitely worth the long drive,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is, in fact, quite a long drive to Ireland, but the introduction of Cate at this juncture feels premature, as Mary's quandary remains unsolved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">soft and long lacy scarf light enough for spring, extra long for winter wrapping, elegant enough for church, cute enough for a tshirt...i really love this scarf pattern (gee can you tell?).<br />
3. i think that packages stacked all over the house are a nice decorative touch (and they remind me how good people are to donate to project 31) happy things!<br />
wooohoooo!</p></blockquote>
<p>And now we seem to have raced ahead to the glorious d√©nouement, wholly skipping the rising action and climax. Yes, by all means, joy and happiness to all, but at no cost to Mary or Irish Cate? The reader is cheated.</p>
<blockquote><p>simple is always prettiest to me.<br />
may the light always find you on a dreary day.<br />
haha, that's my girl.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, a poetic interlude featuring either Mary or Cate as "my girl." The metre escapes me. Perhaps an obscure form of Haiku?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">there's a tiny restaurant<br />
i was given the irish name kelly after my great grandparents' last name.<br />
in a tiny town in idaho<br />
last minute trip to idaho to see my sister- so much better than home blogging!<br />
i am blocking my two latest projects today and will show them tomorrow.<br />
and my wheels are turning with projects to put together for a locals knitting class.</p></blockquote>
<p>We now travel to diminutive Idaho, and the narrator Kelly is introduced, completing the dramatic triad. Cate and Kelly clearly share the Emerald Isle in common, but what of Mary? Will the stacked packages be sufficient to allay her woes?</p>
<blockquote><p>i am craving some sunshine.<br />
and you are happy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simple human truths. A beautiful end to any story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">my sister and hair stylist, coco, is coming to utah county once again to meet our hair needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you've lost me again.</p>
