<p>You won't find "fifi-i-nini" in any dictionary, not even one for crossword puzzle aficionados. Suffice to say, it means "finished" in some French Canadian vernaculars. Also, it's a terribly satisfying way to announce the completion of <a href="http://beta.images.theglobeandmail.com/archive/00402/Globe_and_Mail_holi_402701a.pdf">a lengthy challenge</a>:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://beta.images.theglobeandmail.com/archive/00402/Globe_and_Mail_holi_402701a.pdf"><img class="size-full wp-image-674 " title="The Globe and Mail's Boxing Day Crossword" src="/heap/globe-crossword1.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="439" /></a><p>Hey! No peeking.</p></div>
<p>Carole and I slaved away into the wee hours Saturday night, but it wasn't until this afternoon that we pencilled-in Calder Trophy-winner "rookie" for the final clue.</p>
<p>The solution will be published in <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/">The Globe and Mail</a> on January 2nd.</p>
