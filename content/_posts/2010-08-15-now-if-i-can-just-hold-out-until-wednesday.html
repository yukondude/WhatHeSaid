<p>I've given up playing along with the majority consensus: sunny and warm do not a beautiful day make. As far as I'm concerned, you can all take your sun and shove it where the sun don't shine.</p>
<p>Fortunately, if I can just survive until the middle of this coming week, it'll be my turn to mindlessly blather about what wonderful weather we're having. See how <em>you</em> like it.</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/weather/s0000825.html"><img class="size-full wp-image-1160" title="Oh happy day! Callooh! Callay!" src="/heap/cbc-forecast.png" alt="" width="480" height="195" /></a><p>CBC&#039;s forecast for the week.</p></div>
<p>And to confirm the good news:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/CAYT0019"><img class="size-full wp-image-1161 " title="Blue skies are going to cloud up. Put on a happy face." src="/heap/weather-network-forecast.png" alt="" width="480" height="224" /></a><p>The Weather Network&#039;s concurring forecast</p></div>
<p>I'm not going to explain my meteorological preferences other than to say, yet once more, that you're wrong and I'm right.</p>
