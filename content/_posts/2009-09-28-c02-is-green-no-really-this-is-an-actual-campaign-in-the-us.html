    Wow.  I saw one last week coming out of the State of Washington that showed a grocery-carrying mother complaining about the tough economic times and how a tax on soda would be unfair to her family because, how on earth will they be able to afford the necessity of carbonated beverages if this tax goes through?

    Gee, I wonder who paid for that ad...?

    Michael, the links didn't come through for some reason, but I think this is the <a href="http://adage.com/article?article_id=139281" rel="nofollow">soda tax video</a> you mentioned.

    The US Supreme Court may soon decide <a href="http://phillyfreedom.blogspot.com/2009/09/us-supreme-court-to-consider-corporate.html" rel="nofollow">a case that could do away with limits to corporate campaign donations</a>. If that happens, the CO2 is Green and soda pushers will be able to buy candidates, rather than just TV commercials.

<p>I first read about it <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2009/sep/28/co2-is-green-tv-advert">here</a> (Guardian) and <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2009/09/new-front-group-promotes-idea-co2-green">here</a> (Mother Jones) and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/24/AR2009092404797.html">here</a> (Washington Post).</p>
<blockquote><p>"Higher CO<sub>2 </sub>levels than we have today would help the earth's ecosystems and would support more plant and animal life."</p>
<p>"More CO<sub>2</sub> results in a greener Earth."</p></blockquote>
<p>OMFG. We're doomed.</p>
