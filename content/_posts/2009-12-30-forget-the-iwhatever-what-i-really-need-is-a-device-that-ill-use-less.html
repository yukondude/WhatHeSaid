<p>Whatever device Apple is secretly rushing to market next year -- the iSlate, iTablet, iPlank, or my preference, the iJayKay -- it won't be anything I need. Heck, no one actually <em>needs</em> any of the gadgets that the high-tech companies are shilling these days, but we sure <em>want</em> them. Lustrous, kaleidoscopic, cacophonous, expensive -- who could resist?</p>
<p>However, in the ongoing matter of <em>Want v. Need</em>, the two parties will stipulate the following: what we don't want, and what we certainly don't need, are any more vapid mouth-breathers clogging our sidewalks and stairways while thumbing obliviously on their hand-held "smart" devices.</p>
<p>The troglodytes aren't completely to blame. To be useful, these devices have to be primed with subscription plans and add-ons. To justify the resulting cost, the devices have to be used, routinely to the point that additional plans and add-ons (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/26/need-a-witty-app-for-that-phrase-theres-an-app-for-that/">there's an app for that</a>) are inescapable.</p>
<p>Somehow, Bell Mobility's marketing brochures fail to mention this consequence. It's as if the term "exorbitant death spiral" never occurred to them.</p>
<p>I'm not immune to the siren call of these pandorean gadgets. I'm simply waiting for a model that is useful without my having to, uh, use it: one that buzzes me awake after I've nodded off during a meeting; one that points out the good sandwich places nearby when my stomach grumbles; one that highlights my scarf and toque when the temperature has dropped; one that alerts the authorities after I've fallen into a crevasse on a lonely trail; and one that electronically jams the signal of anyone in my vicinity attempting to text, tweet, poke, or telephone.</p>
<p>In other words, a device to make me feel connected, informed, secure, and, yes, more than a little smug.</p>
