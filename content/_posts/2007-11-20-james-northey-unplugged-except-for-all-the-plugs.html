<p>Carole and I caught <a href="http://www.yukon-news.com/news/19nov2007/3795/">Colin James and Craig Northey at the Arts Centre</a> last night. There's no real point in a review of the show -- you either attended last night or already have tickets for tonight -- but we both enjoyed it.</p>
<p>The real surprise for me was this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Northey" class="def">Northey</a> fellow. I'm not party to the music scene and had never heard of the guy, yet I knew all of his songs (including, of course, the theme from <a href="http://www.cornergas.com/"><em>Corner Gas</em></a>). He's a true song writer, and I would have liked to have heard more. He also produced a very clean tone from his amped acoustic.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_James" class="def">James</a> was less of a surprise; I've been listening to him since <em>Voodoo Thing</em> appeared on the Friday night video show in my high-school days. He sure has pipes though, and fingers to match. I did find his guitar playing a little more cluttered. Nimble digits aside, sometimes there are <a href="http://cheles.wordpress.com/2007/05/14/too-many-notes/">too many notes</a>. But you can excuse a lot when you see how much fun he's having playing -- judging by his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Martin">Happy Feet</a>. I especially appreciated his deviations from standard blues riffs, veering away from dominant seventh chords at unexpected moments.</p>
<p>Although not advertised as an "unplugged" concert, it was more amplified than I anticipated. And, while I completely understand the rationale, I still find it amusing to see a <a href="http://www.marshallamps.com/">Marshall</a> valve amplifier with microphones stationed fore and aft.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Yukon News article, James doesn't have an outgoing stage presence; Northey was visibly more comfortable bantering between songs. That, and the occasional audio glitches -- including a memorable "Whoa" -- made for an intimate event.</p>
<p>I briefly met Colin James in 2000 when he came up to play at the Thunder on Ice race. He was just hanging around the Westmark convention room chatting with anyone. I couldn't muster the courage to ask him about a long-past David Letterman appearance that featured a horribly out-of-tune guitar. Poor guy soldiered on, bending every single note into pitch.</p>
