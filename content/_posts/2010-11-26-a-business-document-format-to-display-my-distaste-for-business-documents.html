<p>I was working on a business proposal today. The sort of work that inspires within a terrible craving for distraction.</p>
<p>"Aha," I said, startling the dog. "I'll design a new format for my business documents. One that emphasizes my comfort with machines rather than humans. One that confidently shatters the conventions of polite society. And, of course, one that can be <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2010/10/22/how-i-make-words/">generated automagically from plain text</a>."</p>
<p>I succeeded...to the extent that my proposal work was postponed.</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><img class="size-full wp-image-1413" title="Remember in grade 8 when Mrs. Tibblestraw taught us how to properly format a business letter? Mrs. Tibblestraw, you can go to hell." src="/heap/yukon-dude-software-business-letter.png" alt="" width="480" height="622"><p>A business document that figuratively screams &quot;I do not care to do business in the accepted fashion.&quot; When sent electronically, a literal scream is attached in MP3 format.</p></div>
