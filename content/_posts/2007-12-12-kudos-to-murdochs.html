<p>My wedding band is a <a href="http://www.murdochs.ca/">Murdoch's Gem Shop</a> special: a benuggetted piece called <a href="http://www.taiyariverjewelry.builderspot.com/i/Casey%20W%20Rings/7B-H_e.jpg">The Sluice Ring</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, sometime between June and last month, the ring had become denuggetted by one.</p>
<p>Murdoch's renuggetted it at no charge, taking less than half the time they originally estimated.</p>
<p>Just one more reason to favour Main &amp; Third over Chilkoot &amp; Quartz.</p>
<p>(Disclosure: I do occasional contract work for Mac's Fireweed Books and some other businesses that share ownership with Murdoch's. None of the Murdoch's staff were likely to have known that though.)</p>
