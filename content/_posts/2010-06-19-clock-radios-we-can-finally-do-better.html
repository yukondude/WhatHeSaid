<p>A couple of years ago, <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/12/13/clock-radios-cant-we-do-better/">I complained at length about the state of the art in alarm clock radios</a>. Doing so doesn't seem to have spurred anyone to invent a better one, but it recently occurred to me that, instead of conceiving a new device from the ground up, one could simply invoke last year's omnipresent tagline -- "there's an app for that!" -- and be done with it.</p>
<p>Apple doesn't seem to allow you to search the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/apps-for-iphone/">App Store</a> without owning one of their precious whatnots (Google's <a href="http://www.android.com/market/">Android isn't any better</a>), but I eventually discovered <a href="http://iphoneapplicationlist.com/apps/">a site that unveils the complete list of iPhone and iPad apps</a>. Sadly, the clock-related apps that I found strive merely to replicate the form and function of yesteryear's nightstand specials. Let's review the shortcomings of those models:</p>
<ol>
<li>miserable timekeeping accuracy,</li>
<li>terrible radio reception and sound quality,</li>
<li>infarction-inducing buzzers,</li>
<li>tedious and minuscule controls,</li>
<li>fixed nine-minute snooze intervals,</li>
<li>displays that render 0, 6, 8, and 9 almost identically, and</li>
<li>poor or non-existent blackout protection.</li>
</ol>
<p>By itself, the smartphone platform is able to address complaints #1 and #7 with network time protocols and onboard batteries. The apps can in turn handle numbers #2 and #3 through audio files or radio streaming easily enough, and some feature ingenious solutions for #4: swiping and shaking motions for scheduling and extinguishing alarms. All of the apps are intent on reproducing problems #5 and #6 though. The upshot is that the current stable of clock apps are, at best, marginally superior to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZbtAFq7dP8#t=8s">Groundhog Day flippers</a>.</p>
<p>What I'm looking for is something way beyond that. Here's a not-an-artist's rendition of my dream (pun!) alarm clock:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/heap/better-alarm-clock.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1083" title="A better alarm clock" src="/heap/better-alarm-clock.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="244" /></a><p>You too can enjoy the ultimate alarm clock experience for the low, low introductory price of just $749, plus shipping and fondling.</p></div>
<p>Ain't she a peach? I'm sure an interface wiz could do much better, but at a minimum, here's what I'd expect from such a wondrous creation:</p>
<ul>
<li>analog and digital time representations, easily read from a metre's distance (more, if using an iPad);</li>
<li>the date;</li>
<li>automatic time zone adjustment;</li>
<li>the current weather and temperature;</li>
<li>the time of the next alarm;</li>
<li>an adjustable snooze duration;</li>
<li>impending appointments from my calendar;</li>
<li>indication of any missed calls or messages while I was asleep;</li>
<li>multiple separate alarms for one person, or for many;</li>
<li>a charging cradle that will display the clock in my preferred orientation;</li>
<li>automatic screen brightness adjustment using the phone's camera to detect ambient light levels;</li>
<li>choice of radio or television streams as the alarm, or stored audio files;</li>
<li>alarm sound levels that increase gradually, along with the screen brightness;</li>
<li>motion, swipe, or shake detection to turn off a ringing alarm;</li>
<li>voice recognition for common settings (e.g., alarm time, snooze duration, phone do-not-disturb);</li>
<li>white noise or soothing sound generation with configurable sleep timer setting; and</li>
<li>other brilliant ideas that I can't think of right this minute.</li>
</ul>
<p>From what I understand, virtually all of that can be accomplished with today's technology. Packing in too many features is a problem in itself, but given the cost of these smartphones, why not exploit them as as much as possible for the third of your life that you're unconscious?</p>
<p>Putting all of that together is something I could do, but someone else could do it better. If you can pull it off, I'll even promise to buy my first smartphone just to run your app.</p>
