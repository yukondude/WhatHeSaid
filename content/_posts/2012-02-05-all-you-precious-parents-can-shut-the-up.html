    I would trade my two doggies for a cat...

    ...just to watch the former cat owner deal with these two gargantuan fur-lined rockets. No more litter box for you!

    Then I'd get my dogs back and sell the cat for $$$. I win!

    Hmm. A couple hundred bucks? I think I smell a rat.

    Which is why I'd want a cat, after all: to get rid of the rats, smell and all.

<p>Here's a fun party game: find the most obnoxious new parent in the room and sidle up. This will invariably be a mother of a Kayden or a Chlöe. Then, during one of the rare pauses in conversation, announce to all "I know exactly what you mean. Raising my two dogs from puppies was exasperating but so rewarding at the same time. I feel blessed."</p>
<p>Oh, but you are now at the receiving end of <em>such</em> a lecture.</p>
<p>This is what childless adults have to put up with each and every stinkin' day. It's just one holier-than-thou moment after another.</p>
<p>If you're wealthy -- and without kids, the odds are in your favour -- you can laugh off the worst of it in your Dom-filled hot tub.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you'll have to develop a very long-range plan to infiltrate and destroy the parenting clique...</p>
