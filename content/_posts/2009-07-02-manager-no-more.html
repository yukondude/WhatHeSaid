<p>It was less than 9 months ago that<a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/10/25/perspective-shift/"> I joined Yukon College</a> as the manager of the Computing Services department. Naturally, only two months later I discovered another opportunity for which I was much better suited. I hemmed and hawed, but finally gave my notice in March, and then counted down my lame duck days to June 30th. I had assumed that I would be replaced long before this past Tuesday, but the position is <a href="http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/human_resources/job_postings/HR0931.php">yet to be filled</a>.</p>
<p>So, I invite any and all qualified individuals to apply. It's a pretty sweet deal and there are few better places to work than the College. I can't stay away: I'll be back in September to teach, and probably take, a course or two.</p>
<p>Now I just have to do the all things I've been thinking about doing since the New Year. Kinda scary, that.</p>
