  content: L-brackets and I had a falling out some years ago. There's still the little
    matter of $50 loaned between parties to clear up before any attempt at reconciliation.

  content: You just have to accept that L-brackets are a little bit crooked.  You
    thing they're going in one direction and then they go off in another.  They're
    not unpredictable, though.  Perhaps my earlier comment should have been "L-brackets
    are your frienemy!"

  content: I'm trying to help a friend rebuild a Day Bed.  Since it was put in storage
    5 years ago, some hardware has gone missing.  The screw/nut/cylinder thing in
    your photo (Top Left &amp; Top Right) is what I imagined would fix it.  We need
    8 of these things.  How do we buy these?

  content: 'Lloyd: they''re called cylinder or barrel nuts. Not easy to find hereabouts,
    but a big city hardware shop might stock them or you can probably find them online
    too.'

<p>Garage sales are a terrific source of baby equipment. Most items have only been pooped on a couple of times before the baby grew too large and had to poop on something else.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a dismaying rule of garage sale purchases states that any item made up of multiple components will be missing at least 50% of said components. This means if you buy a pair of scissors, probability dictates that one of the blades won't be there by the time you get home.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most components can be replaced, often for just a fraction more than the whole item would've cost new.</p>
<p>But in Whitehorse, some components are not so easily found. For example, the cylinder nut -- the preferred fastener of most pressed-sawmill-scrapings furniture manufacturers -- pictured at right. I couldn't find anyone in town that sold something similar, and having bought a 14-piece crib for $25, was missing 7 of the damned things.</p>
<p>"I must repair to the workshop posthaste!" I cried, confusing most everyone, since no one really talks like that anymore, and also because we don't have a workshop. Nevertheless, I was able to fashion a reasonable facsimile of the missing nuts:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><img class="size-full wp-image-1972" title="This photo has been ruled inappropriate for sniggering children and all males under the age of 40." src="/heap/erzatz-bolt-and-nut.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="286"><p>"I can't believe it's not a hex bolt and cylinder nut!"</p></div>
<p>And now the crib is fully assembled, and just as strong as... Well, it hasn't fallen over yet, so that's reassuring.</p>
<p>I'll leave the story of how Carole rebuilt half of a missing stroller safety-belt for another day.</p>
