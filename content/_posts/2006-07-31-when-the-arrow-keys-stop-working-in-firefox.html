<p>I prefer to use the arrow keys to scroll while reading web pages. Every now and then, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> (version 1.5.0.5) stops responding to those keys. The Home and End keys are ignored as well I notice. Today I stumbled upon a <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2394613&amp;sid=fdfb8ff45d8c4f777c5899af0a3b8352">unexpected, but practicable, solution</a> (about 3/4 of the way down the page): choose Options from the Tools menu and then click the OK button.</p>
<p>What's mind-boggling is not so much the solution, but that it was discovered at all.</p>
