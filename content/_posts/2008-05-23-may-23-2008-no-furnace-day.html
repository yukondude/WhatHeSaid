<p>The propane is once again sealed within it's echoing metal caplet. All told, it's been 247 days since <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/09/19/september-19-2007-furnace-day/">the furnace was started on September 19th</a>. That seems about average and works out to about $10 per day, although I have a sneaking suspicion my locked-in price will shoot up this fall.</p>
<p>Now that the bathroom is nearing completion -- <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/03/13/coming-home-to-a-surprise-bathroom-remodelling/">some three months after the wallpaper came down</a> -- I'll be turning my growing renovation skills toward rebuilding and re-insulating the mudroom (or, "arctic entry" as it's known in the local realty listings). That should ease the heating bill a little.</p>
