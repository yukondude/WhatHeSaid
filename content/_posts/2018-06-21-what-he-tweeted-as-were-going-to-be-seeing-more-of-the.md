As we’re going to be seeing more of the surprising Croatian team this [#WorldCup18](https://twitter.com/hashtag/worldcup18), I vote that the announcers drop the “itch” sound from the end of the players’ names to save time. And if Iceland continues to do well, I’ll be making a similar request shortly.
