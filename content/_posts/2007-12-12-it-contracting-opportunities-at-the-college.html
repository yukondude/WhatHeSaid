<p>The word being whispered around is that the Computing Services department at <a href="http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/">Yukon College</a> is under new -- and surprising -- management.</p>
<p>The little that I know about the situation is that said management will likely be searching for IT talent. <a href="/2007/09/04/for-the-first-time-in-many-a-year-tomorrow-is-not-a-school-day/">Given my own experience up the hill</a>, I'd caution against full-time employment, but contracting proposals may be in the cards.</p>
<p>(I'd better stop now lest I blow any chance of teaching there again.)</p>
