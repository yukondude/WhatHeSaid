<p>CBC released a story recently claiming that fully <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/north/story/2007/03/09/yk-pardon.html">one-third of Yukoners have criminal records</a>. At the same time, we know that approximately <a href="http://www.jeuxducanada2007.ca/en/news.php?id=176">4,000 volunteers for the Canada Winter Games</a> -- most of whom hail from Whitehorse -- had criminal checks run on their backgrounds. The recent StatsCan census figures show that <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/north/story/2007/03/13/north-census.html">Whitehorse now has a population of just over 20,000</a>.</p>
<p>So, if one-fifth of Whitehorse's inhabitants are crime-free, and another one-third have records, then ... let me see now ... 1 - 1/5 - 1/3 = 15/15 - 3/15 - 5/15 ... seven-fifteenths, or about 47% of the rest are sitting on the fence. They're the ones to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>To sum up: folks in orange windbreakers are easy marks for the one-out-of-three who are barred from crossing the Alaskan border, and the remainder can't be trusted to help in a pinch.</p>
