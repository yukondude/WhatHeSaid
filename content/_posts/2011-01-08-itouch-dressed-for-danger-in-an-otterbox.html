<p>Known for our butterfingers, Carole and I both ordered <a href="http://www.otterbox.com/">OtterBox</a> protective cases for our mobile gewgaws. Hers was the lighter <a href="http://www.otterbox.com/HTC-G2-/-HTC-Desire-Z-Commuter-Series-Case/HTC4-G2XXX,default,pd.html?dwvar_HTC4-G2XXX_color=20&amp;start=1&amp;cgid=desire-z-cases">Commuter model</a> for her HTC Android phone which even works with the swing-out keyboard, but I got the <a href="http://www.otterbox.com/iPod-Touch-4th-Generation-Defender-Series-Case/APL2-T4GXX,default,pd.html?dwvar_APL2-T4GXX_color=20&amp;start=1&amp;cgid=ipod-touch-4th-generation-cases">indestructo Defender case</a> for my iTouch.</p>

<p>It's made of two snap-on hard plastic shells (one with a built-in screen protector) and a grippy rubber sleeve that stretches over the whole thing, without blocking any of the important orifices (including the Apple logo on the back).</p>
<p>The case actually makes it much easier to grasp the thing, because the iTouch is actually a little too thin, if you ask me. Beefing it up with the OtterBox gives it a much better "heft."</p>
<p>I haven't tested its durability yet, and hope never to, but it seems solid. I recommend it highly, and, even though the company is in the States, they managed to deliver all the way up here in only a couple of days for ten bucks.</p>
