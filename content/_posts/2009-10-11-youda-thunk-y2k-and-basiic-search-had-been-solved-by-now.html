    Somehow I doubt I have that much pull with the Chicago papers, and I'm sure I wasn't the only one complaining.

    What I still can't believe is that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid only got two-and-a-half stars.

<p>Computer programmers, rejoice! With 2010 nearly upon us, we can celebrate that all of the fundamental problems in computer science have been put to rest.</p>
<p>What's that, you say? Try a search for "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" on the <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/">Roger Ebert page of the Chicago Sun Times</a> site? Well, okay...</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/heap/future-butch-and-sundance.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-579" title="Only 22 more years until Casablanca premières." src="/heap/future-butch-and-sundance.gif" alt="Only 22 more years until Casablanca premières." width="381" height="311" /></a><p>Only 22 more years until Casablanca premières.</p></div>
<p>So, searching for a very specific film title matches the intended review on the penultimate line of the third and last page of results, while adding a surplus century to the date. Oh, and articles that aren't reviews are displayed as though they were very bad reviews.</p>
<p>Attaboy!</p>
<h3>Update, October 16th</h3>
<p>Looks like the Sun Times wunderkinder fixed it, apparently by rolling back to the old search code.</p>
