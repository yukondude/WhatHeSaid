    getting maximum 2-3 out of every 100 spam messages in my inbox. I don't get many
    e-mail messages a day, and it seems like I'm about 75% legitimate in my inbox,
    say six good ones and two bad ones on an average day. \n\nI've been freely posting
    my various e-mail addresses all over the web for years.  \n\nI'm so fearless I'll
    even post it here: \nanthony.delorenzo@gmail.com\n\nNyah, nyah, come and get me!\n\nRegards,

    Gmail does have a very good spam filter. Unfortunately, their servers are located in the US which opens them up to Patriot Act and future south-of-the-border legislative abuse.

    I have three layers of spam filtering on my accounts, but occasionally I peek into the rejected bin to look for false positives, and that's when I spotted the gobbledegook.

    But I don't get any spam to the whathesaid account. I believe that's because I don't advertise it. Isn't no spam always preferable to some spam?

<p>Last I week I wrote about the <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/10/23/am-i-not-master-of-my-e-mail-domain/">hijacking of my e-mail domain by spammers</a>. I happened to mention that the messages that were rejected by other e-mail recipients had been purportedly sent from the address <code>qqx<em>gobbledegook</em>@yukondude.com</code>. The "gobbledegook" that appeared in italics was meant to signify a random alphabet soup that followed the oddball "qqx" prefix.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, I received an e-mail this very morning addressed to a certain <code>qqxgobbledegook@yukondude.com</code>. It contained an offer of cheap replica diamonds and Rolexes.</p>
<p>Well that didn't take long.</p>
<p>Obviously a spam harvester program -- or, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spambot" class="def">spambot</a> -- stumbled upon my posting and scooped up that address. Spambots are automated browsing programs that surf the web looking for anything resembling an e-mail address: <code>this@that.theother</code>. The addresses are collected and used to send enticements for the aforementioned ersatz diamonds, or other equally dubious products and services.</p>
<p>That's why it's never a good idea to publish your e-mail address on the web, at least in its unprotected form. Instead, websites that need to publish a contact address will use an image of the e-mail address, or a JavaScript-scrambled version, or a wacky spelled-out representation: for example, <code>dave [strudel] whathesaid [full stop] ca</code>. Eventually the spambots will grow smart enough to decipher those, but to date I haven't received any spam addressed to my "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%40" class="def">strudel</a>" account.</p>
