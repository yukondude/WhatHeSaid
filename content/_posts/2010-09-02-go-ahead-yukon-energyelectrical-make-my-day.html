<p>I dare you. In fact, on the advice of my legal counsel, I double dare you. Just try to kill my laptop with a power spike:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><img class="size-full wp-image-1204" title="From the Wile E. Coyote school of power conditioning." src="/heap/spike-proof1.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360"><p>For portability, the 25-pound uninterruptible power supply may be fitted with an attractive carrying handle.</p></div>
<p>(It's actually thought to be a <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/xyzcomputing/daisy-chain-your-ups-20041213/">bad idea to daisy-chain surge protectors</a>. That didn't stop me from once attempting to build a perpetual electrical generation machine by plugging together two uninterruptibleÂ power supplies in a loop. Genius!)</p>
