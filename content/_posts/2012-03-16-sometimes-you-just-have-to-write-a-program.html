  content: I know what you mean.  Quite some time ago when I was doing early Java
    cell phone development, I needed a way to capture the emulator screen so that
    I could make an animated .GIF file from it.  I spent three days looking for a
    good solution only to finally decide to spend a few hours making my own from Java's
    Robot class.  Sometimes you just have to roll your own because you are the only
    one who knows exactly what you need.

    that: all needs are specific and unusual if they''re not already being met.'

<p>I'm a UNIX pipe enthusiast.</p>
<p>Well, <em>that</em> came out a little more bong-like than intended.</p>
<p>What I mean to say is that, when I have a computer problem to solve, I prefer to solve it using ready-made little programs that are then strung together to do the job. The metaphorical string is the UNIX pipe operator -- the vertical bar thingy on your keyboard that looks like this: | -- which simply takes the output of one program and makes it the input to the next.</p>
<p>It sounds simple. It is simple. And yet it can do astounding things. All without having to write a program, in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>The other day I strung together a doozy of a command necklace to download the web pages for a course at the <a href="http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/">College</a>, strip out the navigation links, simplify the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> code, and then package the whole megillah into a format that could be loaded into <a href="http://www.campuscruiser.com/">the College's learning management system</a>.</p>
<p>For a number of reasons, not the least of which my hubris, it didn't really work all that well.</p>
<p>So, after the requisite fruitless twiddling-of-the-command-switches exercise, I threw out the idea and began writing it all out again as a program, written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> this time around. I like Python.</p>
<p>There's no life lesson in any of this, told by way of pipe analogies. No particular computer programming lesson either.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can take a big problem and break it into simple, easily digestible chunks, and solve it with off-the-shelf utilities. Sometimes you just have to write a program.</p>
