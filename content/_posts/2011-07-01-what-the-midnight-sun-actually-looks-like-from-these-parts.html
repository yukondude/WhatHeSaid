<p><a href="http://youtu.be/JFnSbLx-AFk">This video</a> was apparently shot between midnight and 10am on June 21st, from <a href="http://travelyukon.com/about-yukon/yukon-communities/burwash-destruction">Destruction Bay</a> looking out over Kluane Lake, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Highway">Alaska Highway</a> community about a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Whitehorse,+Yukon+Territory,+Canada&amp;daddr=Kluane+Lake,+Destruction+Bay,+Yukon+Territory,+Canada&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=60.983767,-136.922607&amp;spn=2.214417,6.80603&amp;sll=60.986431,-136.928101&amp;sspn=2.214231,6.80603&amp;geocode=FXt2ngMd8Ezz9ymBU7yAmERUUTFLNdBk6rc95A%3BFcz_pgMdR9O69ynXYgJ05rtSUTECzGjzTYuhxQ&amp;mra=ls&amp;doflg=ptk&amp;t=h&amp;z=8">three-hour drive west of Whitehorse</a>.</p>
<p>Since we're slightly below <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle">66° 33′</a>, you'll see that the sun does set, but it never gets darker than a southern dusk. The longest days last for a couple of weeks on either side of the summer solstice.</p>
