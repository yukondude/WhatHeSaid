    I don't think it has either. It really does seem to want to do without anything but the text. I leave it in plain text mode and don't even bother with italics or titles or any of that sort of thing. <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2010/10/22/how-i-make-words/" rel="nofollow">(I then run a home-made script to convert it to pretty and print-ready HTML or PDF.</a>)

    The only extra feature it seems to have is a timer or word counter that will tell you if you've reached your daily goal or not. I find that a bit pointless and ignore it.

    There are lots of other <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=word+processor+for+writers" rel="nofollow">word processors just for writers</a>. I'm sure outlining is a feature of many of them, but I just use a separate document for that and do it manually (if I do it at all).

    Yes, absence of penguin is a show-stopper for me.

    One feature that caught me off guard was that it always writes out files in Unicode with a leading UTF-8 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" rel="nofollow">BOM</a>, so don't use it to edit configuration files.

<p>I just discovered <a href="http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/">FocusWriter</a>, a free writer's word processor that runs on most any operating system. I'm going to give it a try because the glitzy windowÂ <a href="http://www.learnthat.com/define/view.asp?id=7415">chrome</a> that ornaments most word processing tools is too distracting. Here's a snapshot of my entire screen when it's running:</p>
