<p>Each morning at about a quarter of six, the dogs and I pass this lookout point on our rounds. I usually stop to take it in for a while before moving on. It's humbling to think that this expanse is a mere fifteen-minute stroll from my door. For the locals, this is looking west-by-northwest-ward-ish from the <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=60.714413+N,+135.117438+W&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=60.714413,-135.117438&amp;spn=0.008722,0.026586&amp;sll=60.714413,-135.117438&amp;sspn=0.008722,0.026586&amp;t=h&amp;z=16">ridge between Ingram and McIntyre</a>. Haeckel Hill is on the right.</p>

<p>The panorama was taken with <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photosynth/id430065256?mt=8">Microsoft's Photosynth app</a> for <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=iPhod">iPhod</a>. Oh to have been the Apple employee that demanded Microsoft's incorporation papers in order to register an app developer account.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=48f473e2-c12c-4d71-9e2c-a9327f6a0431&amp;m=false&amp;i=0:0:0&amp;c=0:0:0&amp;z=530.803552962474&amp;d=-1.10376263380803:-1.26192859208928:-1.33570560639081&amp;p=0:0&amp;t=False">view the panorama interactively</a><sup>*</sup>. And <a href="http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=b1d54522-7378-4af0-8920-4759bc7a4029&amp;m=false&amp;i=0:0:0&amp;c=0:0:0&amp;z=530.803552962474&amp;d=-1.26099031227262:-1.26099031227262:-1.174999922972&amp;p=0:0&amp;t=False">this one too</a>, taken from a slightly different spot, although the app did something funny with the trees.</p>
<p><sup>*</sup>Update, July 2nd: I thought at first that you would need <a href="http://www.silverlight.net/">Microsoft Silverlight</a> installed on your computer, but it appears you don't need it just to view the panorama.</p>
