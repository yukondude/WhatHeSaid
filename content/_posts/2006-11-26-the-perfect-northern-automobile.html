<p>Another crisp November morn in the Yukon. Through the parts of the windows that haven't frosted over, the day looks bright, cheerful, and at -35째C, utterly uninviting.</p>
<p>Even more forbidding is the notion of driving anywhere on a day like today. I ensure that I remain stranded in my cozy, comfy house by consciously neglecting to plug in the truck's block heater. It will take a good four hours of power and another twenty minutes of squeal-filled idling before that frozen Ford will move.</p>
<p>School days leave me fewer options. The block heater and battery blanket power kicks on at 5am. I run out to turn over the engine a quarter-hour early. The exhaust fumes are thick with uncombusted gasoline -- a litre or two of dollar-per fuel to bring the engine to temperature. The fan belt screams at the effort. Just prior to departure I scrape the frost from the windows, including the inner surfaces on occasion. To leave the driveway, I must convince the transmission that it can overpower the congealed differential and axle bearings. Finally, we're off, bouncing for the first kilometre like the balls in a child's popcorn push toy because of the flat spots frozen into the tires.</p>
<p>No, driving below -30째C is neither a pleasant nor an inexpensive proposition; I estimate a month is taken off the life of the vehicle for every turn of the ignition key.</p>
<p>It would help if car makers designed for this climate. Given the sparse demographics and accelerating global warming, they likely never will. Nevertheless, here's my wishlist for the perfect -- or, failing that, the least-miserable -- northern automobile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command start. This one's a must. For some twisted reason, my Ranger's security system precludes the installation of this feature. Instead, I have special big boots waiting by the door that I can slip on for each morning's dash to the ignition.</li>
<li>All-around jet-powered defrosters. I'm looking for the same effect as window-mounted blow torches.</li>
<li>Block heater, battery blanket. Duh.</li>
<li>Heated steering wheel. I suspect that heated seats are a bit of a gimmick, but a heated steering wheel would be pure pleasure. It's easier to crank the frozen steering when unencumbered by mittens.</li>
<li>Heated tires. I don't think this even exists, but if a Hummer can change its tire pressure dynamically, then I don't see why you couldn't warm the tires with air. Frozen tires can pop right off the rim -- that is one tire change you want to avoid.</li>
<li>Studded tires. It may sound like you're driving on crackers, but not even ice tires come close when you have to stop or turn on ice.</li>
<li>Low center of gravity. As someone who has rolled off the highway in a high-riding four-by-four, I now see the advantage of a squat body profile.</li>
<li>Good ground clearance. Big wheels and bigger fender wheel wells should be enough to keep from getting hung up on snow without making the car top-heavy.</li>
<li>Always-on all wheel drive. Four wheel drive means you'll never get stuck in a drift, but it can't be left on all the time. AWD should help with all of those slippery corners at intersections.</li>
<li>Heated drivetrain. This doesn't exist either, but the transmission and bearings take a beating when the car first starts to roll. Seems to me that a heating element is cheaper than a tranny replacement.</li>
<li>Low-temp catalytic converter. I'm not sure of the chemistry involved, but the exhaust emissions in cold weather are pretty brutal. The last time it dropped below -45째C, my check engine warning light came on for a month; I was convinced that the overly-rich exhaust had poisoned the catalytic converter. That doesn't seem to have been the case, and may not even be possible for all I know, but I think everyone will agree that internal combustion in cold weather is no friend of the environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>All told, that will add up to a lovely winter driving experience, although one that I probably can't afford. It's time to admit that, so long as you don't mind helmet hair, a snowmobile really is the best commuter vehicle hereabouts.</p>
