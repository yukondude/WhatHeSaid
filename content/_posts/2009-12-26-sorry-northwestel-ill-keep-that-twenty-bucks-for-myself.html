  content: Just goes to show how much we value the convenient and the conventional.
    Of course, the next generation to pay telephone bills has a very different notion
    of convenient and conventional. Their dollars will speak far more loudly than
    our griping.

<p>Christmas morning: brew coffee, open presents, call umpteen relatives down south.</p>
<p>Apparently others keep the same schedule as "all of our circuits are busy" was all we heard from the telephone yesterday morning.</p>
<p>So, we cranked up <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> on the computer (we have a $30/year <a href="http://www.skype.com/allfeatures/subscriptions/">Skype Out plan</a> which lets us call any US or Canada phone number) and subsequently paid NorthwesTel a grand total of $0 for about two hours' worth of holiday chatter. The Ottawa call suffered from considerable delay and echo, but the other calls were as clear as a regular phone.</p>
<p>From this, I can make two observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>We need a computer that's as easy to turn on as a telephone. (Or <a href="http://www.skype.com/allfeatures/togo/#toGoCountriesTab">Skype To Go</a> for Canada.)</li>
<li>All we want from the telcos is for them to ship our bits. If they won't drop their <a href="http://yukonchatterbug.com/2008/08/03/skype-hype/">ridiculous and complex plans</a>, we'll just move to ones-and-zeros traffic until they've no choice.</li>
</ol>
