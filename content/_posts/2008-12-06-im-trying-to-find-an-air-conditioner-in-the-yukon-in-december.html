<p>That is an excerpt from an actual conversation held with a plumbing and heating contractor. I will likely soon forget the circumstances of yesterday's telephone call, but those sentence fragments deserve to live on.</p>
<p>The following won't be news to anyone supporting an older laptop in the suggested position: computers are hot. And not "hot" in the way marketing departments or Paris Hilton mean. No, they're just hot. Damned hot.</p>
<p>And that which gets too hot needs cooling. You wouldn't think that would be difficult to accomplish in this region, and in this season, but from a concrete-enveloped tomb in the basement of a large building, geography and weather don't play a role.</p>
<p>Long story short, the requested A/C unit arrived at the exact moment that it was no longer needed.</p>
<p>Now if only I could find a way to <a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/85850.html">ship all of this coal to Newcastle</a>.</p>
