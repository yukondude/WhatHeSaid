<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://graphjam.memebase.com/2009/09/18/song-chart-memes-operating-systems/"><img class=" " title="Click for a larger view. Or, just move your head closer to the screen." src="http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/song-chart-memes-operating-systems.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="243" /></a><p>Everything in life can be explained with three circles. Except bicycles.</p></div>
<p>As I <a href="http://twitter.com/yukondude">tweeted</a> on a frosty Christmas afternoon, Santa tucked an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/ipodtouch/">iPod Touch</a> into my stocking.  I had explained earlier to Carole -- Santa's agent -- that I "needed" one for a) a mobile app project that I start in the new year, b) translation for our upcoming Korea &amp; Japan trip, and c) because it's totally cool and doesn't require a soul-crushing contract with Bell Immobility.</p>
<p>So now, what with Carole buying a reconditioned <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> from her school, our house literally hums with operating systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS,</li>
<li>Mac OS X,</li>
<li>Android,</li>
<li>virtualized Windows XP/Vista/7,</li>
<li>two flavours of Ubuntu Linux, and</li>
<li>whatever it is that's running the kettle.</li>
</ul>
<p>All we need now is a Blackberry and the thing that Palm is grasping as an emergency flotation device and the circle will be complete. Heaven help us when it comes time to upgrade.</p>
