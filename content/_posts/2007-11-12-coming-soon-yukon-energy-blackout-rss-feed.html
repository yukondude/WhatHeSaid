  content: Yep, most, if not all of the time, blackouts and failures are YECL's fault,
    not the other way around. Unfortunately, YEC always gets to be the scapegoat.

  content: And yet only YEC's site talks about power outages. YECL seems solely concerned
    that street lights might go dark. That, and how to decipher one's bill.

  content: Speaking of bills, I gotta admit that I'm pretty proud of the YEC <a href="http://yukonenergy.ca/customer/residential/reading/"
    rel="nofollow">Reading Your Bill page</a>, which I hand-coded. Still looks good
    and works reasonably well after all these years. I love web standards.

    Sweet. Some real table wizardry and I always appreciate neat and tidy HTML source code.

    That's some sample bill: $173.47. Mine is usually between a third and a half of that. Time to invest in CFLs and clotheslines.

<p><em>This is one more page in the Yukon Blackout Mashup &amp; Feed Saga.</em></p>
<p>In response to <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/10/29/i-also-want-a-yukon-energy-blackout-rss-feed/">my recent request</a>, I received a note from <a href="http://www.yukonenergy.ca/">Yukon Energy</a> (YEC) that they've asked their site developers to add an RSS feed to announce planned power outages. I was cautioned that it may take a while to appear though.</p>
<p>I was also cautioned that the RSS feed may not be what I want anyway, since it is actually <a href="http://www.yukonelectrical.com/">Yukon Electrical</a> (YECL) that deals with power distribution inside Whitehorse; YEC handles generation and distribution to some communities. I guess it's now time to prod YECL's PR flacks.</p>
<p>My original quest for a <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/10/24/i-want-a-yukon-energy-blackout-mashup/">blackout map mashup</a> is less certain to be realized, by companies with "Y", "E", and "C" in their abbreviations, at any rate. Perhaps there's another way...</p>
<p>On a related note, it's an unnerving thing to drive down Hamilton Boulevard <a href="http://www.whitehorsestar.com/auth.php?r=49090&amp;arc=1">without the leading glow from street lights</a>.</p>
