  content: Have you tried <a href="http://www.tucows.com/preview/610631/Chromium-Browser?q=chromium"
    rel="nofollow">Chromium</a>? It's the same codebase, style and behavour of Chrome,
    without the Googleness attached. I've been using Chromium for about a month and
    it's pretty darned awesome.

  content: Geof, I started on Chromium since, at the time, that was the only option
    for Linux. I didn't realize it was less-googly in nature, but I suppose since
    it's an open source project, it could be modified to be whatever. I moved to Chrome
    once it was stable on Linux.

<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html">Firefox</a> has got to go. It was terrific in its day, but has now succumbed to two horrid Microsoftisms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Software that grows slow and fragile with age, and</li>
<li>Reboots are necessary to correct #1.</li>
</ol>
<div class="captioned-image"><img class="size-full wp-image-815" title="Glossy doorstop." src="/heap/google-chrome.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="192"><p>To log in to Chrome, repeat the sequence of musical tones in the correct order.</p></div>
<p>My own installation had become ramshackle, forgetting toolbar customizations haphazardly, and completely spazzing-out on the <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> site.</p>
<p>So I chucked it and hopped aboard <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>, the latest browser bandwagon.</p>
<p>Soon will come a day when your <a href="http://robulack.wordpress.com/2009/12/11/google-chrome-a-web-browser-to-make-you-yawn/">choice of web browser</a> is as meaningful to you as your favourite brand of celery. <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/what-is-browser.html">We're almost there</a>: when asked which browser they use, my students will respond "<a href="http://ca.msn.com/">MSN</a>," or simply, "the internet." But I'm not yet prepared to stipulate browser fungibility.</p>
<p>What Firefox had going for it was extensions: little add-on customizations to, let's say, hide advertisements, report the weather, signal incoming e-mail, and generally add a dash of <a href="http://www.ernhrtfanracing.com/images/2010TMMCContigs.jpg">NASCAR design sensibility</a> to your humdrum windowed existence.</p>
<p>Chrome followed with its own extensions: smaller, slightly less capable, but <code>&lt;megaphone&gt;</code> installable without restarting the program <code>&lt;/megaphone&gt;</code>.</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><img class="size-full wp-image-825" title="Looka them itty-bitty buttons. Which'un's the one fer Penzoil?" src="/heap/chrome-extensions.png" alt="" width="480" height="30"><p>This sort of thing can get out of hand right quick.</p></div>
<p>Dear reader, I'll spare you the full accounting, but in the above image, Chrome is telling me that I have three newly-arrived e-mails, one hour until my next meeting, forty-one irrelevant things to read, no ads disturbing my view, and a partly cloudy, -7°C day outside.</p>
<p>Yet with all of these add-ons, uh, added-on, Chrome doesn't seem to succumb to the lethargy of a similarly blinged-out Firefox. Overall, Chrome appears to be one of the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5457242/browser-speed-tests-firefox-36-chrome-4-opera-105-and-extensions">snappiest browsers</a> available:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><img class="size-full wp-image-827" title="Bigger is better...that's what she said!" src="/heap/browser-performance.png" alt="" width="480" height="208"><p>A good looking, but otherwise meaningless performance chart. But good looking.</p></div>
<p>As you might expect, Chrome has googly-search-goodness baked into the address bar, with a swifter touch than Firefox's <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2008/04/21/a-little-something-awesome-about-firefox-3/">awesome bar</a>.</p>
<p>For the second year in a row, Chrome was the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ytech_wguy/20100329/tc_ytech_wguy/ytech_wguy_tc1360">only browser impervious to hacking attempts</a> at the <a href="http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/blog/2010/02/15/pwn2own-2010">Pwn2Own</a> competition.</p>
<p>Of course, Chrome is not all smiles <em>und</em> sunshine. In particular, the tab placement and operation takes some getting used to. Closing the last tab, for instance, shuts down the entire browser. The optional <a href="https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html">decorative themes</a> also seemed designed to camouflage the tab and window buttons.</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><img class="size-full wp-image-832" title="Tabs on top? Sacrilege!" src="/heap/chrome-tabs.png" alt="" width="480" height="25"><p>You will frequently close the wrong tab. Store Nerf balls within reach to express your frustration in a socially responsible manner.</p></div>
<p>Chrome has crashed on me a couple of times; something Firefox hasn't done in a while. It does feature some form of session recall, however, as the same tabs reload the next time you launch the program.</p>
<p>Finally, it is upsetting to trust something so fundamental as browsing to a large multinational. At least Firefox was produced by (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/20/mozilla_2008_financials/">Google-sponsored</a>) volunteers. But there's always "who couldn't love cuddly Norwegians?" <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> for the unassuaged (or, cuddly-<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=cupertino+california+apple&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=1&amp;ei=_zi2S8eSKJ2QsAOBxKyvBQ&amp;sig2=QzTZHy-QPtyUsnEFGxoo5Q&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;view=map&amp;cid=9414575226159102133&amp;ved=0CDEQpQY&amp;hq=cupertino+california+apple&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=37.331676,-122.030382&amp;spn=0.045521,0.090895&amp;t=h&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A">Cupertinian</a>-produced <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, for that matter).</p>
<p>Once I suppress my inner socialist, I can bring myself to really enjoy surfing with Chrome. It's early days yet, but I'm impressed with the browser's demeanor. True, while that is an anthropomorphic opinion of a web browser, it's not as though I'm claiming that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTTzwJsHpU8">Internet Explorer is mean to me</a>.</p>
