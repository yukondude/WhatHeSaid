<p>I am not often invited to cocktail parties. When I am, however, I inevitably face the "And what exactly is it that you do for a living?" question. I prefer to mumble something about "computers" and let the conversation die a quick, painless death. Just in time to refill my <a href="http://www.whiskymag.com/cocktails/saratoga_fizz.html">Saratoga Fizz</a>.</p>
<p>Thing is, "computers" is a pretty big field, and my job is just one little slice of the spectrum. Cramming automotive engineers, chauffeurs, mechanics, and gas pump jockeys into a large box labelled "cars" is a reasonable parallel.</p>
<p>Programming -- or "software development" when it's salary negotiation time -- is my chosen career. Unlike the doctor, the lawyer, or the exotic dancer, the programmer is not cocktail party material. The programmer offers few cocktail party-sized services: I can't repair your printer, expunge your spam, or add decimals to your bank account.</p>
<p>So what is it that programmers <em>do</em>? Well, they convert general-purpose computers into dedicated-purpose machines by writing software, but that doesn't tell you anything you already didn't know.</p>
<p>Instead, if you really want a taste of what it is to be a programmer...write instructions to a house-sitter for operating your TV/VCR/DVD/Satellite/Stereo setup.  Your instructions are the software, and the house-sitter is the computer: able to do simple tasks but not without specific direction and explicit context.</p>
<p>Operating my TV is a nightmare for the uninitiated. For example, to watch a DVD,</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn on the DVD player and insert the disc.</li>
<li>Turn on the TV, set the volume to about 15, and press the Video button at the base of the set (it's not on the remote).</li>
<li>Turn on the Stereo and switch the input to AUX. Set the volume control about halfway (the TV speakers don't work properly so the stereo is required).</li>
<li>Play the DVD by using the controls on the squarish-edged Panasonic remote. Control the volume on the round-edged RCA remote. Don't press the channel buttons or you'll have to get up and press the TV's video button again.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Separate and different instructions are required for watching VHS tapes or listening to CDs. It is not currently possible to listen to the radio because the dog ate the antenna.)</p>
<p>Even given these instructions, it's uncertain whether the prospective house-sitter will be able to watch DVDs. I've left out all sorts of information about locating the devices and associated buttons, restarting the system after <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2007/10/24/i-want-a-yukon-energy-blackout-mashup/">power outages</a>, and dealing with accidental resets of the universal remote. More instruction, more context, more explanation and correction of exceptional circumstances is clearly needed.</p>
<p>That's what it is to be a programmer. Hence the Saratoga Fizz.</p>
