<p>Thinking about <a href="/2007/11/30/eight-years-in-yukon/">how I came to be in Whitehorse</a> the other day led me to reminisce of the many places I've hung my hat in this great land (and a couple other lands). If I limit myself to locations where I spent more than one month and also received mail, I count twenty-two addresses on Memory Lane.</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.ca/">Google Maps</a> affords a virtual romp through the neighbourhoods of my past, and using the <a href="http://maps.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=68480">My Maps</a> feature let me <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=109741260839247010273.00044029a08bf0d9ff95d&amp;ll=48.224673,-83.320312&amp;spn=107.307686,239.0625&amp;t=h&amp;z=2&amp;om=1">trace said romp across my personal sector of the globe</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=109741260839247010273.00044029a08bf0d9ff95d&amp;ll=48.224673,-83.320312&amp;spn=107.307686,239.0625&amp;t=h&amp;z=2&amp;om=1"><img src="/heap/where-he-lived.jpg" title="View Where He Lived Google Map." alt="map" height="147" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>To dissuade repo men and groupie stalkers, I've left out dates and also been a bit sloppy with my coordinates.  The planet also seems to have accumulated quite a few more condos than I remember from the 70s, so I had to guess at a couple of spots.</p>
<p>For those wanting to do one better, you can attach images and videos to your maps.</p>
<p>"Now who's in the mood for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_8_mm_film" class="def">Super 8</a>  reel of 1960s-era <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Place_to_Stand,_A_Place_to_Grow" class="def">Ontari-ari-ari-o</a>? Anyone? Hello?"</p>
