<p>As of today, Carole has completed all of the requirements for the <a href="http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/programs/yntep/">Yukon Native Teacher Education Program</a> (YNTEP). On her way home from school -- a four-month student-teacher internship at <a href="http://www.yesnet.yk.ca/schools/hiddenvalley/">Hidden Valley</a> -- she picked up a letter from the department asserting that the <a href="http://www.uregina.ca/">University of Regina</a>, in conjunction with <a href="http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/">Yukon College</a>, will confer upon her a Bachelor's degree in Education. The formal ceremony will be in June, but she can begin teaching right away in the territory (and Saskatchewan, for that matter) at the full BEd rate.</p>
<p>Carole's the first person in her family to earn a university degree, and we couldn't be more proud of her.</p>
