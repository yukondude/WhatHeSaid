<p>Soon to be a new father, I've learned many things about parenthood of which previously I had no earthly idea. To begin with: storage.</p>
<p>As in, where, exactly, does one store a baby?</p>
<p>Apparently babies require an entire room. A thousand cubic feet for an eight pound dumpling.</p>
<p>Or, for those of a metric inclination, 17.2 decicoulombs for a 2.63 megatesla spaetzle.</p>
<p>The only candidate room in our compact house was the office. Specifically, my office, shown here in its circa-2009 state of efficient disorder.</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><img class="size-full wp-image-1845 " title="Proof of a 1986 crime: Glebe Avenue sign that was ripped from its housing during a midnight escapade with Brian Hampson, of Vancouver BC. Arrest that man, officer!" src="/heap/office.jpg" alt="" width="370" height="404"><p>At first, I didn&#039;t see why you couldn&#039;t sneak a crib up under the computer monitor. After all, &quot;it&#039;s a terrific, flashing, buzzing, wire-y mobile.&quot; I was overruled.</p></div>
<p>"Besides," we agreed, "a remodelling will give us the opportunity to finish the back wall of the adjoining bathroom, <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/03/13/coming-home-to-a-surprise-bathroom-remodelling/">the renovation project we began four years ago</a>."</p>
<p>(<em>Editors Note: That line of dialogue seems awkwardly expository. Please revisit.</em>)</p>
<p>We began in March by pulling out everything that wasn't nailed down, and one wall that most stubbornly was.</p>
<p>The two breaker panels in the corner, one in a box, and one exposed with non-clad Romex stapled to the wall, required special consideration. In the end I encased the entire corner and built a simple set of cupboard doors for accessing the panels. Aside from the occasional beverage, these doors are the only level and plumb objects in the building.</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><img class="size-full wp-image-1853" title="Below the lower panel, the opening is essentially bottomless, and therefore attracts all manner of expensive fasteners." src="/heap/breaker-panel.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="323"><p>If you quickly flit your eyes from left to right, an animation of the breaker panel&#039;s history will reveal itself.</p></div>
<p>Once that was done, it was a simple matter of rebuilding the wall, priming, painting, flooring, trimming, painting, scratching, and re-painting and the baby storage room was complete.</p>
<p>It's now quite apparent that the room is not nearly large enough for all of the baby supplies we've amassed to date. And the occupant hasn't even arrived yet.</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><img class="size-full wp-image-1856" title="After all was said and done. It occurred to me that I had forgotten to re-open the hole in the floor for the heating register. I wonder where I should start drilling?" src="/heap/nursery.jpg" alt="" width="370" height="404"><p>You won&#039;t be able to see it, but the Ernie and Bert (or &quot;Bernie and Ert&quot; as I call &#039;em) light fixture is the same that graced the old office.</p></div>
