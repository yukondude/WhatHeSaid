<p>It took me a while to thumbnail-ify it, but this is the poster that I submitted as the major assignment in last term's <a href="http://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/arts_science/course_outlines/SOCI209.pdf">SOCI209: Society, Technology, and Values</a> (PDF) course.</p>
<p><a href="/heap/network-privacy-poster.jpg"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="/heap/network-privacy-poster.jpg"><img src="/heap/network-privacy-poster-thumbnail.jpg" title="Privacy and the Network poster" alt="Privacy and the Network poster" border="1" height="327" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Click to see the <a href="/heap/network-privacy-poster.jpg">full-size ~380KB version</a>. I don't think I'll link to the 8MB <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Png" class="def">PNG</a> original.</p>
<p>My goal in creating the poster was to show that the value we place on privacy is in a steady state of decline since the advent of digitized persistent storage -- the Network -- and increases only transiently through public shocks of violation.</p>
<p>I was never entirely satisfied that the poster's narrative was sufficiently persuasive, and visually it's too wordy, but I still think it looks pretty sweet. The glossy 2' x 3' version hangs over my desk at the College and never fails to impress...me.</p>
<p>I created it using <strike>Macromedia</strike> <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks/">Adobe Fireworks</a>, the only graphics program I've ever even partly glommed.  Probably the trickiest bit was drawing the green circuit-board-ey border.</p>
<p>Of course, the day after I dropped it off at Staples to be printed, <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/doubleclick.html">Google announced their acquisition of DoubleClick</a>. One more slight upward blip in our value of privacy before the bottom drops out.</p>
