title: If you're looking for a scuffed but solid L-shaped full-sized wooden desk,
  look no further than the Whitehorse dump's free store.

<p>I can't think of all that much else to write. The title is pretty self-explanatory.</p>
<p>We dropped it off this afternoon and protected it from the elements as best we could. All the drawers, legs, and fasteners are included.</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="http://whathesaid.ca/heap/desk.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1138 " title="A terrible example of ergonomic monitor placement, if you ask me." src="/heap/desk-300x257.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="257" /></a><p>Artist&#039;s conception of free desk left leaning against the free store shed. Not exactly as shown.</p></div>
<p>The desk looks something like the photograph to the right, but is a bit darker and made with thigh-bruising sharp corners.</p>
<p>I hope someone can give it a home before the next rain showerÂ de-laminates the edge trim even further. The top surfaces are in very good shape.</p>
<p>It's built like a tank, so bring a friend and a truck to cart it away.</p>
<p>I bought it from a used furniture store in Kingston about 20 years ago and it has served me faithfully for all that time.</p>
<p>I guess I could think of more to write after all. Sniff. Goodbye ol' Desky McDeskerton. Sniff, sniff.</p>
