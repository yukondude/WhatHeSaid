  content: This "The Start bar and caps lock and Are You Sure? popups can all go to
    hell." pretty much sums the whole thing up.

  content: Yes, I can live with those dastardly idiosyncrasies as the price for not
    being confined to the locked and claustrophobic iPad environment. But few others
    care.

<p>April third! <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a> day! Or, iPad day for those in the States. Or, iPad day for <a href="http://robulack.wordpress.com/2010/04/02/first-in-line/">those so infatuated with the latest Apple gewgaw that they're willing to fly down to Seattle and stand in line in the rain at 2:00am</a>. What's the <a href="http://www.traveldocs.com/ca/customs.htm">duty-free limit for a 48-hour trip</a> again?<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-848" title="Ignore what you're seeing. You. Will. Buy. This. Because." src="/heap/ipad.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="316" /></p>
<p>I'm not likely to have an iPad anytime soon. I haven't even laid eyes on an iPhone yet. But I have the sneaking suspicion that iPads and other <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/03/12/seven-alternatives-to-the-apple-ipad/">ersatzPads</a> will be a hit with casual internet users.</p>
<p>Notice I didn't say "computer users": no one wants to use a <em>computer </em>-- people just want to do internet stuff. The Start bar and caps lock and Are You Sure? popups can all go to hell. The iPad-style interface, as limited as it is, has simplicity working for it. Technology geeks generally don't appreciate simplicity, but my mom does.</p>
<p>There's the argument for the iPad right there: no more calls from back home asking about missing files and uninstalled device drivers. Sign me up.</p>
<p>But I suppose I should at least wait until someone invents an iTriangle to rest the thing on. Oh wait, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/04/02/make-a-lap-stand-for.html">someone already did</a>.</p>
