<li class="ws_tweet">Thank you, <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23RobFord">#RobFord</a>, for ruining another mad lib: &quot;At least my city&#039;s mayor isn&#039;t as much of a ____ ____ as Toronto&#039;s ____ ____.&quot; <a class="ws_tweet_time" href="http://twitter.com/yukondude/statuses/335767127564881922">2013-05-18</a></li>

<li class="ws_tweet">A pox on gadgets that take an odd number of batteries. Alternatively, a pox on battery manufacturers that only sell them in even numbers. <a class="ws_tweet_time" href="http://twitter.com/yukondude/statuses/337239677511823361">2013-05-22</a></li>
