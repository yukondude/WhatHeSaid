  content: Amazing - I wonder why YTG got almost no bids on those lots! What were
    the people involved thinking? Not only the path - whenever the subject of Ingram
    comes up, the common comment is something like "would YOU build there?"

  content: Whatever you do build, you'll have to hold your breath in order to squeeze
    through your front door. Some of the lots are pretty tight together.

    that's about it.

  content: Hello there!  LOVE the satire with this post.  It was Really fun to read
    (Yes, I meant to capitalize the R in Really because using all capitols is overrated.)  I
    have to say that I haven't gone through the Ingram subdivision yet, but I hoped
    to.  Now i know I won't be able to fit my daughter's stroller through the footpath.
    :S  Thanks for sharing! I laughed my butt off.

  content: going entirely without capitals is also overrated. e e cummings and k d
    lang can just go to hell. i prefer the german approach which consists of randomly
    choosing a part of speech to capitalize. were it up to me, i'd pick articles 'cause
    there's only two of 'em.

<p>Should you accompany your dog on a morning constitutional through <a href="http://www.city.whitehorse.yk.ca/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC={C3FC62AC-A4B7-4408-AF74-C3F1172AB5C9}">Whitehorse's new Ingram subdivision</a>, you're bound to come across this scene before long:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="/heap/ingram-path-full.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1351" title="Subliminal message: wobbly unicycle riders are not welcome here." src="/heap/ingram-path.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="397" /></a><p>"Ode to Committee Planning" by Anonymous. 10m × 2m installation. Sheet metal, concrete, dielectric fluid, asphalt.</p></div>
<p><em>Click the image to further magnify the enormity of the error.</em></p>
<p>Clearly, several landscaping constraints were in conflict during the design phase. That, or there's a new bylaw mandating wheelchair-accessible transformers.</p>
<p>It's also evident that, after the fact, common sense was engaged to solve the wrong problem:</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="/heap/ingram-path-adjustment-full.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1354 " title="Wings aren't just for panty liners any more." src="/heap/ingram-path-adjustment.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="248" /></a><p>The lay observer may not realize that the green obelisks are aligned to the Equinox Sun.</p></div>
<p>Are we looking at the future inspiration for a sick skateboarding trick?</p>
<p>If you've not visited Ingram yet, I encourage a drive-through (as your walking route may be obstructed). The subdivision is constructed almost entirely from pavement so that every lot has a back alley access. Here are a couple more dull morning snapshots as enticement.</p>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="/heap/ingram-east-full.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1356" title="Seriously, this will be skateboard heaven." src="/heap/ingram-east.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="202" /></a><p>Ingram East: the ideal spot to grab a latte and people-watch.</p></div>
<div class="captioned-image"><a href="/heap/ingram-west-full.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1357" title="Dog not to scale." src="/heap/ingram-west.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="290" /></a><p>Tour the shops, check out a show, it&#039;s all here in Ingram West.</p></div>
