<p>Unlike many, I'm averse to writing about personal matters on my blog. For the most part, I stick to jargoned wisecrackery.</p>
<p>I've been in Toronto for the past two weeks to be with my father, as has my brother, Iain, who flew in from Korea. My father, Henry "Hank" Rogers, died last night as Iain, his spouse Dennis, and I stood around his bed in the living room of his Scarborough home.</p>
<p>We are well prepared for the flurried activity that will occupy us throughout the coming week. Following that, the schedule is less certain.</p>
