    Yes. Seriosly!
    Curiousity kills the cat, or is it curiosity?
    Sorry hun, just had to bug you about your spelling mistake. I know, I know, I make many a spelling errors. But to find one that YOU made and to realize that you thought you spelled it right is worth documenting.
    Gotta love me.

<p>Seriously? Let me get this straight: upon viewing the title "No Furnace Day" your brain saw fit to order your hand and finger muscles to perform the complicated orchestration of a mouse click, all so that it could satisfy its "No Furnace Day" <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #ff0000">curio<s>u</s>sity</span>.</p>
<p>And now that your brain has realized its mistake, your appendages are frantically grasping for the back button.</p>
<p>Too late! There's still time for your brain to absorb this: "all told the furnace ran for 235 days this past winter, 12 less than the <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/05/23/may-23-2008-no-furnace-day/">previous year</a>."</p>
<p>Goodbye.</p>
