<p>Carole just got back from racing in yesterday's 18th annual <a href="http://www.kcibr.org/">Kluane Chilkat International Bike Relay</a>. No results are posted yet (she rode leg 8 for team enDURANce enDURANce -- complete with 80s apparel), but she was curious just how long the full course is from Haines Junction, Yukon, to Haines, Alaska. Both common sense and the relay website will tell you it's about 240km all told, but I typed it into a search bar and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Haines+Junction,+YT,+Canada&amp;daddr=Haines,+AK,+USA&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;mra=ls&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=46.092115,93.076172&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;z=5">Google Maps responded with this astounding figure</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Haines+Junction,+YT,+Canada&amp;daddr=Haines,+AK,+USA&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;mra=ls&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=46.092115,93.076172&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;z=5"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1097" title="Distance from Haines Junction YT to Haines AK" src="/heap/distance-to-haines.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="260" /></a>That seemed a little longer than I remembered. A glance at the suggested route explained the discrepancy:</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Haines+Junction,+YT,+Canada&amp;daddr=Haines,+AK,+USA&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;mra=ls&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=46.092115,93.076172&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;z=5"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1098" title="Directions from Haines Junction YT to Haines AK" src="/heap/directions-to-haines.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="582" /></a>What Google Maps missed was a little highway called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haines_Highway">Haines Road</a> that leads almost directly from point A to point B. A minor detail, really. Hardly worth bothering about.</p>
