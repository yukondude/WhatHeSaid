    Brrr.

    Try living in a city that isn't used to solid water coming from the sky... Cabin FEVER...  people don't want to go out and do stuff until liquid water returns.  Sigh.

<p>Cold air descends, and cold weather also seems to pour down from the higher atmosphere. It nestles in the low spots, squirms around a little to get comfortable, and then locks in tight for the duration.</p>
<p>A cold snap focusses the out-of-home priorities and schedules. Errands and visits must be strung like beads on a short thread.</p>
<p>As a concept, spontaneity loses meaning below minus twenty. The block heater has seen to that; all impulses are tempered by a four-hour lead time.</p>
<p>That is the discipline of the plug.</p>
