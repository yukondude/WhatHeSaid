<p><a href="http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/default.asp">Stephen Harper</a> has taken some flack for describing Israel's response to the Hezbollah as "<a href="http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=296184ac-63d1-4dca-a85c-1552513c7490">measured</a>". I've also seen the word "proportional" bandied about.</p>
<p>I'm forced to -- reluctantly -- side with our PM: Israel's response has been measured, and in a unexpected way it is also proportional, and that's the problem. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Israel and its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces" class="def">IDF</a> had every reason to respond to the kidnappings and rocket bombardment with an uncompromising and ferocious massed counter-attack. That it didn't is the very definition of "measured".</p>
<p>Instead, Israel took the aerial superiority route and employed various standoff munitions to target Hezbollah's positions and supply chain. The Americans had already refined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_and_awe" class="def">this technique</a> in Iraq, with equally disastrous results, borne in the main by the civilian population.</p>
<p>So what we're left with is two opposing forces, lobbing weapons back and forth over the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Line_(Lebanon)" class="def">Blue Line</a>. In this sense alone, Israel's response is proportional. I think this parallel leads world opinion toward the notion that both parties are similarly aggrieved.</p>
<p>But the power of Israel's weaponry is completely out of proportion with the unguided rockets that are flung southward. So now Israel takes on the -- not unfamiliar -- role of the regional bully, driving world opinion toward a censure of the "oppressor" nation.</p>
<p>I'm led to believe that the only way Israel could have defended herself from both the rockets and the frowns of world opinion would have been through a very costly infantry-led house-by-house purging of the Hezbollah militia. The Lebanese army would then have had to move in, perhaps with international assistance, to restore order as the Israelis withdrew.</p>
<p>Okay, that last paragraph was a real work of fantasy. Apparently my harebrained ideas are just as harebrained as those of others.</p>
<p>These are some well-written articles that helped me better understand the situation (free registration required in some cases):</p>
