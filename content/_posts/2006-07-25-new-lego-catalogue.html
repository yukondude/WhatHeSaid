<p>The Summer 2006 <a href="http://www.lego.com/">Lego</a> catalogue arrived in the mail today. As usual, it's brim-full of over-specialized Star Wars, weirdo mechanized alien, and now Batman, kits. My inner curmudgeon would beef about the dearth of plain-old studded rectangle bricks, but I actually get a kick out of the newfangled <a href="http://www.lego.com/eng/create/technic/productPage.aspx">Technic</a> pieces.</p>
<p>Page 46: <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/">Mindstorms NXT</a> is out. (Warning: music, of the sort that you might expect to accompany a plastic robot, will play when clicked.) Now all I need is $350 clams. That, and a bucketful more robot-building enthusiasm than I had for the original Mindstorms.</p>
<p>If you look through the catalogue for any length of time, it soon becomes apparent that every single photo caption -- every stinkin' one of 'em -- ends in an exclamation point. To wit:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Desert skiff measures 20cm long!"</li>
<li>"Three floors of treatment rooms!"</li>
<li>"Hatch opens!"</li>
<li>"Cook a hearty meal in the galley!"</li>
</ul>
<p>I am I somehow unaware of a Danish bent for this most clumsy of all punctuation marks?</p>
