<p>It's such a rare and pleasant experience to find exactly what you were looking for. Just his past week, I asked <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/09/12/can-anyone-recommend-an-unmanaged-virtual-private-server-hosting-company/">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/60137/technical-issues-when-switching-to-an-unmanaged-virtual-private-server-vps-host">elsewhere</a> for a recommended <a class="def" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a> hosting company. I didn't get -- nor did I expect -- many responses, but at least a couple suggested <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">SliceHost</a>. Positive and detailed reviews of their service were easy to find. I have now moved my various web properties, including my e-mail server and this blog, to a new SliceHost "slice" down in Missouri.</p>
<p>For just $20 per month, I've got complete control over a virtual quad-core server with 256MB of memory, 10GB of disk, and 100GB of monthly bandwidth. It's everything I wanted and nothing I didn't. Ubuntu OS? Check. Root access? Check. DNS zone control? Check. Reverse DNS? Check. Extra IPs? Check ($2/mo extra).</p>
<p>It's early days yet, but so far SliceHost has lived up to its rave reviews.</p>
<p>Now, unmanaged VPSs aren't for everyone: I had to install the webserver, database, e-mail server, and my own <a href="http://code.google.com/p/klondike-firewall/">klondike firewall</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/scripnix/">scripnix utilities</a>. But <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/products/WhatIsUbuntu/serveredition">Ubuntu</a> and <a class="def" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool"><code>apt</code></a> did most of the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>With all that out of the house, I can finally ditch my static-IP business internet plan and switch to a cheaper residential one. I can also turn off my spare-bedroom server without fear of losing incoming e-mail. That'll come in handy shortly as I have to fix the bathroom fan which is on the same circuit.</p>
<p>(It's always a bad idea to run computer equipment from the same circuit as noisy electrical motors. I have specific rules -- often ignored -- specifying into which outlet the vacuum cleaner can and can't be plugged. A dedicated circuit just for the computer equipment would be a fine idea, <a href="http://whathesaid.ca/2008/03/13/coming-home-to-a-surprise-bathroom-remodelling/">once the bathroom is finally finished</a>...)</p>
