    has lasted for over 20 years though.

<p>Or so say many hundreds of daily e-mail messages. Genuwine and authentik Rolexes and Cartiers, available at mall aisle prices. Perfect for one-upsmanship occasions like reunions, sales meetings, and church confessionals.</p>
<p>Subscriptions to <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/">Wired</a> and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a> only accentuate my lack of refined chronometry. <a href="http://robulack.wordpress.com/2007/08/10/it%e2%80%99s-an-ad-ad-world/">Andrew recently bemoaned the advertising-to-editorial ratio of Wired</a>, but it pales when compared to the Cosmo-esque glossies published during the Go-Go-IPO excesses of the late 90s.</p>
<p>Wired also takes pain to point out my inadequate vehicle, shoes, booze, hotel choice, and, were I to own one, cell phone.</p>
<p>The New Yorker is much more eclectic in defining my wants. Sprinkled amongst the solicitations for TAG Heuer, Breitling, Rolex, Audemars Piguet, Victorinox, Patek Philippe, and -- lastly -- Omega, are offerings of <a href="http://www.wideshoes.com/">excessively broad shoes</a>, <a href="http://www.john-christian.com/">lurid jewelry</a>, <a href="http://logansquareeast.com/">seniors' storage</a>, <a href="http://www.starclippers.com/index_en.html">clipper cruises</a>, and, in every single issue, <a href="http://johnhelmer.com/prod.itml/icOid/490">$14 European berets</a>.</p>
<p>True, a $14 European beret would attract attention away from my oh-so naked wrist. And the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/60098975">two-foot-diameter Ikea Bravur</a> adorning my living room means that I'm never tardy. But I still can't help feeling that I'm missing out on life's natural Swiss-certified jewelled movements.</p>
