<ul class="ws_tweet_list">
<li class="ws_tweet">Saw mention of something called &quot;unchat&quot; out of the corner of my eye. Is this the 7Up of instant messaging? No, merely French for "a cat". <a class="ws_tweet_time" href="https://twitter.com/yukondude/statuses/503167073879461889">2014-08-23</a></li>
<li class="ws_tweet">While I&#039;m pleased that Dropbox has increased my storage to 1TB, with my rural DSL connection, it would take me 257 days to upload that much. <a class="ws_tweet_time" href="https://twitter.com/yukondude/statuses/505389558268039170">2014-08-29</a></li>
<li class="ws_tweet">...but of course my NorthwesTel internet bandwidth cap means that it would take 10 months to upload 1TB, rather than merely 8.5 months. <a class="ws_tweet_time" href="https://twitter.com/yukondude/statuses/505390227091763200">2014-08-29</a></li>
