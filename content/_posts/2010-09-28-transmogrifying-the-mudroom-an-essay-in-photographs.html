    Seriously, I laughed out loud at the very same spot!

  content: 'Michael &amp; Fawn: Thanks, and yes, it did turn out well, except that
    the panelling started warping soon thereafter from the August rains and now the
    September snow. We''ll probably have to take it down next summer and either repair
    or replace it. It''s all my fault for having this idea: "Panelling, now <em>there''s</em>
    a good idea."'

  content: Kara, you can thank Carole for the tile floor. That was all her idea and
    it's the best part of the room.
