<p>Carole couldn't sleep last night at 2am, so I wasn't allowed to sleep either. The local Twitterati were abuzz over the snow. I said, "I think it's snowing outside." Carole went to look and all I heard in reply was "Oh, my god."</p>

<p>The snow had built up enough by morning to make it difficult to open the door (which swings outwards for some unfathomable reason).</p>
