<ul class="ws_tweet_list">
<li class="ws_tweet">So much newborn baby gear both vibrates and plays cheezy tunes. It&#039;s like rafting through the Its a Small Word ride on a magic fingers bed. <a class="ws_tweet_time" href="https://twitter.com/yukondude/statuses/452460249560006657">2014-04-05</a></li>
<li class="ws_tweet">I donâ€™t always eat pork rinds, but when I do, I prefer to imagine a time before I was eating pork rinds. Stay greasy, my friends. <a class="ws_tweet_time" href="https://twitter.com/yukondude/statuses/454344892878057472">2014-04-10</a></li>
<li class="ws_tweet">I&#039;m browsing a catalogue of wood screws. I&#039;m bored. Not nearly as bored as the poor sod who posted the screw photographs in the first place. <a class="ws_tweet_time" href="https://twitter.com/yukondude/statuses/454348915358179329">2014-04-10</a></li>
