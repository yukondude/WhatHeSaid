<p>God bless the computer support technicians, every one.</p>
<p>I've never worked in tech support, but I have filled in for vacationing/ill/hiding supportfolk and, as a "computer person", I've helped my share of friends, family, and coworkers out of their simple problems and into giant, bottomless ones.</p>
<p>In one such instance back in 2000 or so, I was briefly manning a Whitehorse ISP's support desk. A woman called in needing assistance setting up her network connection. I first asked if she was using Windows. She was. I began walking her through the procedure, from the Start menu, to the Control Panel, and then on to the TCP/IP configuration under the Network Connections doohickey.</p>
<p>All seemed to be going well until I asked her what she had displayed in one of the configuration screens. Her answer was completely perplexing; she didn't seem to be looking at anything like the same screen that I had before me.</p>
<p>Since I had Windows 2000 on my desktop, and most customers had Windows 95 at the time, I expected a little bit of difference, but nothing she described sounded like anything I knew from 95, 98, or even 3.1.</p>
<p>I asked her again if her computer was running Windows, Microsoft Windows to be precise. "Oh, yes" she replied, quite certain.</p>
<p>We started from scratch, but the next time through, things got even more confusing. Nothing she described on her screen sounded the least bit familiar.</p>
<p>Then it hit me.</p>
<p>"Is your computer a pretty blue colour?"</p>
<p>"Yes, white and blue. Why?"</p>
<p>"Is the word 'iMac' printed on the front."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. My computer is a Macintosh."</p>
<p><em>Silent scream.</em></p>
<p>"Oh, then I've been giving you all the wrong instructions because I thought you were using Microsoft Windows."</p>
<p>"I am using windows. The windows are all over my screen."</p>
<p>"Yes, I understand. I just thought you were using <em>Microsoft</em> Windows. Windows with a capital W."</p>
<p>"Should I be pressing the shift key when I type?"</p>
<p>I must have some support technician blood in me, because I managed not to lose it at that point. I calmly guided her through the Macintosh setup procedure (with one of the graphic designer's help because I don't know jack 'bout Mac).</p>
<p>The real support guys probably know how to pronounce capital letters over the phone. God bless 'em.</p>
