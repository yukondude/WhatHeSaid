The author of this very blog, Dave Rogers, is a sometimes-programmer and sometimes-teacher living alongside the edge
of the known world in [Whitehorse](http://www.city.whitehorse.yk.ca/), [Yukon](https://travelyukon.com/).

Dave offers random programming services as the principal of the inaptly-named
[yukon dude software](https://yukondude.com/)

From time to time, he also teaches various [computer courses](http://college.yukondude.com/) at
[Yukon College](https://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/).

Let's see... what else. [Raised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glebe) in Ottawa.
[Schooled](https://www.queensu.ca/) in Kingston.
[Careered](https://www.bmo.com/nesbittburns") [in](https://www.ssctech.com/) Toronto.
And then---so completely sick of Ontario by this point---relocated beyond the 60th parallel.
